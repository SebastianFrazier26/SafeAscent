Probably just D1. SE aspect. Was able to self arrest fairly easily and the slide path was not long. Still got taken for a ride and it was not a good feeling. 

Our objective was to ski an apron, and we followed a skin track that we knew was bringing us to another place, but we thought we could traverse over once above treeline. Should have just skinned up to the apron we planned to ski. Instead, we ended up far above our objective in a wind-loaded chute. My partner side-stepped down the thin coverage, and I tried to find deeper snow to ski down. Unfortunately, the deeper snow was the wind-loaded snow. 

Lucky to not have any injuries and not have been carried very far. Close call. "

One rider rode on a 38 degree slope over a creek bed while his partner rode nearby. The rider triggered a weak layer approximately two feet below the surface. The resulting avalanche slid into the creekbed and buried the rider 2-3 feet deep. His partner noticed no engine noises and returned to find an avalanche had occurred. He began companion rescue efforts and began CPR upon finding his partner buried beside his snowmobile on flat ground at the base of the slope. The rider had deployed his airbag in the slide but the short distance the avalanche fell (~60 feet) allowed no time for the airbag to lift him to the surface. The avalanche (SS-AMu-D2R3-O) failed on a layer of surface hoar that had developed in this moist, cold, wind sheltered spot near the creek. Find more information about this avalanche here and a video here.

BTAC forecasters extend their deepest condolences to family, friends and others affected by this tragedy. Forecast staff will produce a more detailed report as more information becomes available. Thanks to Lincoln County Sheriff’s office and especially Star Valley SAR for providing details about the accident.

We saw cracking while booting to our objective, redirecting the path around slabby areas. We ski cut the upper chute. The wind slab we triggered cleared the upper chute and skier's left of the lower run. The ski cutter entered an island of safety midway, stopping above the uncleared snow. The 2nd rider stopped below the 1st. 

The 3rd leapfrogged, entering the untouched slope, with the speed from the upper chute. It cracked above him with an 8 to 14 inch crown. It caught, carried, and briefly buried him. He grabbed a tree, dislocated his shoulder, and ended up on the surface. As the other two dropped to help, the upper skier triggered the remaining hangfire, which carried the lower rider. The slide stopped after 10-15 feet. Shoulder relocated, descended the rest of the way to Haiyaha, ascended Dream Ridge, and shredded out the dream chutes. Spirits were high, we were happy to be at the trailhead; a beer was drank, and we talked about our experience after. 

The lower section often sheds while entering the island of safety, when in similar conditions. The leap frogging, the lack of a second ski cut, skiing(shredding) fast into uncleared terrain, and additional hangfire. We knew the terrain, we knew the conditions, we had a plan. We deviated with the leapfrog."

The slide occurred on an S to SE facing slope at approximately 6200ft. One member of the party was not buried. Another teammate was partially buried but injured. The other two individuals were fully buried. During the initial rescue, the team located one of the buried victims, who did not survive. Despite the group's best efforts, they could not pinpoint the fourth member of their team. The party contacted 911 via a satellite device, and Kittitas County Search and Rescue responded to the area on Friday evening. Additional rescue efforts were postponed until daylight. Search and Rescue then returned to the site on Saturday and were joined by NWAC forecasters. The teams were able to locate the remaining victim.

The snowmobiler was buried and killed in the avalanche.   A group of 5 snowmobilers were riding between Castle and Basin Peaks where the avalanche was triggered during the early afternoon and was reported at 2:30pm.  After the avalanche occurred, the remaining group searched, found, and dug up their partner and began CPR.  The group was assisted by other riders in the area that responded and helped with CPR and communications.  Organized search and rescue operations responded to the incident.      

SAC Forecasters went to the avalanche site and gathered additional information on Tuesday, January 6, 2026.  We found a size D2 wind slab avalanche that ranged from 1 to 2 feet deep, 330' wide x 150' vertical drop.  Gale force winds on Sunday night through Monday (Jan 4-5) transported a considerable amount of snow at the tail end of the Friday-Sunday (January 2-5) storm cycle that brought 2 to 4 feet of snow to the forecast region.  Large amounts of blowing and drifting snow were ongoing when the avalanche occurred.  We saw multiple previous slab avalanches that occurred during the Sunday-Monday period in this area.  This wind slab avalanche had wide propagation on a steep slope that ran down into dense trees.  The strong winds formed dense slabs of wind drifted snow on top of less dense layers of snow.  Rimed needle snow crystals were identified in the non-persistent weak layer associated with this avalanche.

Our condolences go out to the victim's family and friends and all those affected by this tragic accident.  We have limited information about the group and where the riders where on the slope when the avalanche was triggered.  It is believed that the avalanche was triggered while traversing low on the slope.  We will update this page as more details become available.

The terrain was wind-loaded with drifts on the ridge and piles of wind-driven sluff debris beneath short, rock outcroppings. Both avalanches propagated 100 to 150 feet across the 40-45 degree slope. The debris ran 1,000 feet (600’ vertical fall) to the base of the gullies, carrying and critically burying the first skier.

Group 1 set a skin track up the valley and unknowingly across an avalanche path. They made one ski run down, and then climbed a little farther west to a flat bench just above the treeline. They described what happened next in their observation:


""Once we arrived at the bench, we headed to the west at a group of trees to a perceived safe spot. A steeper slope was above us separated by some flat terrain and some small trees, about 500 - 800 ft away from our location. We decided to travel across a more connected slope to another safe spot one at a time, and then transition there to head down. When the first skier stepped onto the connected terrain, he remote triggered a small slide at the top of the slope above us, about 500 ft away (or more). When that began to move, it stepped down and caused the entire slope to release all the way to the ground. The first skier scrambled across to the safe spot, and the first two skiers stayed in the safe spot they were in.”


The group yelled “avalanche!” The avalanche broke 200 to 300 feet wide and ran past them. A member of Group 1 realized that Group 2 was following their track. Group 1 got their transceivers out and began to descend the avalanche path.


Group 2 had discussed the avalanche forecast and the HIGH (4 of 5) danger in the area. They were familiar with the area and planned to avoid avalanche terrain for the day. They followed the skin track Group 1 made. In their observation, Group 2 said:


""Our party of 3 was skinning/ascending towards the saddle.  Above us was [Group 1], we were friends with one member of the higher party and were on the same radio channel.  We had all talked at the top of our first lap.


Our best guess is that [Group 1] remotely triggered the avalanche at somewhat of a bench. We could not see them at that time. The upper party yelled avalanche to warn us. We saw the avalanche coming down and were hit.  All three of us were caught and carried between 30-50 ft, and for a moment had snow over our heads/faces. None of us were fully buried.  [Two of the skiers had avalanche debris covering body parts (partially buried - not critical) , but were able to free themselves and] it took about 20 seconds to be standing."" 


Groups 1 and 2 made voice contact after the avalanche and confirmed that everyone was okay. Group 1 helped Group 2 retrieve their equipment. Two skiers continued down the avalanche path, conducting a visual and transceiver search. They determined no other parties were involved. All six skiers descended back to the trailhead. Nobody was injured in this incident.


Neither group realized that the skin track crossed an avalanche path. There was poor visibility on December 6 with strong winds and heavy snow. A member of Group 2 stated that it was too cold and windy to keep taking out their phone to navigate using a mapping app. "

Two mountaineering rangers in the area spotted the splitboarder on the surface of the debris and responded in minutes. After quickly assessing the splitboarder, the rangers initiated a beacon search. They found and exposed the skier within 9 minutes. ""CPR was initiated but discontinued after forty minutes due to traumatic injuries and no pulse.""

There were strong winds and some snow during the previous days and the slope was likely cross loaded. The slope heated up later in the day and the snow became moist by the time of the avalanche.

Skier 4 chatted with these skiers about the riding conditions. They said conditions were not good and that the snow was not powder. 

At approximately 9 AM Skier 4 left Emerald Lake and ascended the apron between the Dead Elk couloir (climber’s left) and the Dragon’s Tail Couloir (climber’s right). He was aware of a natural slide in the Dead Elk couloir. The weather was sunny at this point. Where the apron divides into two couloirs, Skier 4 transitioned to follow the bootpack set by the earlier group. Cloud cover increased as Skier 4 ascended. He noticed the snow becoming wet. 

At approximately 10 AM, Skier 4 decided to end his ascent and start skiing down. He made a couple of turns before hearing a whooshing sound like a wave behind him. An avalanche swept him off his feet. He quickly lost both skis. The avalanche carried Skier 4 approximately 600 to 800 vertical feet down the couloir and onto the apron. He came to rest on the surface of the snow. Skier 4 walked down to the trailhead. Several groups had witnessed the avalanche and checked on Skier 4. At the trailhead, he talked to Rocky Mountain National Park rangers and a Friends of CAIC trailhead outreach coordinator.

Another group of three backcountry tourers had climbed to the top of Dragon's Tail along the ridgeline and descended after Skier 4. They came across the avalanche debris with skis sticking out. After not finding an avalanche transceiver signal, two group members continued to probe the debris, while the Skier 7 went down for help. Skier 7 spoke with the Rocky Mountain National Park rangers and a Friends of CAIC trailhead outreach coordinator at Bear Lake.

They planned to ski the K Chute of the Sky Chutes, a series of steep, westerly-facing avalanche paths that drop down the west side of the Tenmile Range. The group discussed the avalanche forecast, and they all carried avalanche rescue gear. The group had left a vehicle in a parking area below the Sky Chutes earlier that morning.

The group walked down mostly bare ground from the ridgeline to the top of K Chute. The group put skis on and skied the upper low-angle snowfield together for a few turns. They described the snow conditions as crusty. When they stopped, the group wound up in different spots before entering steeper terrain. Skier 1 radioed the group to discuss descending the section. Skier 2 descended next and had made several turns past Skier 1 when he triggered the avalanche. The avalanche broke above Skier 2 and swept him down the path. 

Skier 1 lost sight of Skier 2 and began to descend the path. Skier 1 got his avalanche transceiver out and also communicated with Skier 3 on the radio. He asked Skier 3 to call 911, letting him know he was beginning to search. Skier 3 did not call 911 due to miscommunication. After a few minutes, Skier 1 spotted Skier 2 in the still-moving avalanche debris. Skier 1 watched Skier 2 move to the left and out of the debris as the avalanche slowed down.

Skier 1 reached Skier 2, approximately 1100 vertical feet from where Skier 2 was caught. Skiers 3 and 4 reached Skier 2 a short time later. Skier 2 was injured but not buried. He had lost both of his skis in the avalanche. Skier 1 assisted Skier 2 in walking down the gully to the skier’s right side onto bare ground. They continued to descend, walking on bare ground. Eventually, they ran out of bare ground and were postholing in soft, wet snow, making travel very difficult. The group realized that Skier 2 had another set of skis in the parking area near the bottom of the path. Skiers 3 and 4 went to retrieve the skis. At the parking lot, they realized they didn’t have climbing skins, and postholing back up the path was too difficult with the snow conditions. Skier 1, who was carrying climbing skins, left Skier 2, descended to the car, retrieved Skier 2’s other skis, and re-ascended to where he left Skier 2. Despite injuries, the two skiers were able to ski down to the car, where they met Skier 2’s spouse, who transported him to the hospital. 

Around 2 PM, a second group of two skiers left the Breckenridge ski area from the same backcountry access point with the same goal of descending K Chute. When the two skiers reached the top of the K Chute, they saw the crown of the avalanche. They weren’t sure when it had occurred. They had a photo from earlier that morning and realized the avalanche wasn’t there at 8:30 AM. The two skiers descended the path with their avalanche transceivers in search mode. They found and transported Skier 2’s skis as they descended. A third group descending the K Chute also conducted a transceiver search of the avalanche debris.

The searching groups reached the bottom of the avalanche debris without detecting a transceiver signal. They called 911 to ask if the avalanche had been reported. They were told it had not been. The Summit County Sheriff's Office and the Summit County Rescue Group (SCRG) were dispatched to the scene. As the rescue group organized, they were alerted by St. Anthony Summit Hospital in Frisco that they were caring for a person caught in an avalanche in the Sky Chutes. SCRG matched the skis found in the K Chute with the description of  Skier 2’s skis."

They were aware of the avalanche center, but at least one had not read the avalanche forecast for that day. They had initially planned on riding in the flats near the parking lot, but ultimately rode up to Seattle Ridge and descended into Main Bowl, west of the ridge. They had three snowmachines with two riders doubling on one of the machines. After riding in Main Bowl, they worked their way south along the ridge and descended into Warm-up Bowl.

There is a terrain feature in the upper part of Warm-up Bowl that can be used as a natural snowmachine jump. The jump feature sits directly below a large slope that a rider has to climb a short way up to turn downhill before hitting the jump. There were multiple tracks on and around this terrain feature before the group started riding. The two riders who were doubling made their way down into the bowl to this feature. The feature itself is a major catchment area, acting as a terrain trap for the overhead avalanche path. Rider 1 wanted to jump, so they dropped off Rider 2 at the base of the slope near the jump feature along with their avalanche airbag pack, then proceeded to hit the jump. Riders 3 and 4 remained at the top of the ridge and were watching from above.

Around 2:30 pm, Rider 1, while near the bottom of the slope above the jump, triggered a large slab avalanche that released approximately 200’ above them. The avalanche caught Rider 1, who struggled to get off to the side of the moving debris. Rider 3 said they almost made it off the slab before the snowmachine turned over, and both the machine and rider were carried into the terrain trap (jump feature). Rider 2 remained near the jump feature during the avalanche, and when the debris came to rest, they were roughly 20 to 100’ away from the looker’s left side of the debris. Riders 3 and 4, after witnessing the avalanche, rode down to the debris and quickly realized both the snowmachine and rider were fully buried."

The individual was believed to have been skiing alone in the backcountry area near Hoyt Peak, located northeast of Kamas City.
Search and Rescue (SAR) resources were immediately deployed and initiated a coordinated search. Due to hazardous and ineffective searching conditions, SAR commanders made the decision to temporarily suspend the search late on March 7, with plans to resume operations at sunrise. Search efforts resumed at first light on March 8.

During the initial search, SAR teams identified an area where an avalanche had recently occurred. It was unclear at that time whether the overdue skier had been involved in the avalanche. Due to extremely hazardous conditions, additional resources were requested to assist with avalanche mitigation, allowing searchers to operate safely and effectively.

Tragically, at 10:49 AM on March 8, the overdue skier was found deceased. It was determined the person involved in the accident was 51 year old, Micheal Janulaitis from Marion, Utah. Micheal used a snowbike to access the terrain, but was caught, carried, and killed in an avalanche while skiing a steep, northeast facing run in Hoyt Bowl.

One of the riders in Group 1 was caught in the flowing avalanche debris and pulled his avalanche airbag. When the debris came to a stop, he was partially buried with his head above the snow. The other two riders from Group 1 managed to self-arrest on the bed surface below the cornice, but their snowmobiles were pulled downhill by the debris. 
   
A rider in Group 2 jumped off the cornice, likely not seeing the avalanche on the slope below. He inadvertently rode into the flowing debris. When the avalanche came to a stop, he was partially buried with his head above the snow. Riders from Group 3 at the bottom of the slope scattered and rode away as the avalanche ran toward them. No one in Group 3 was caught. Four riders from two different groups were caught. Two were partially buried, but luckily, nobody was injured.

Grand County Sheriff's Office received a call about a ""massive avalanche.” They initiated a search and rescue response. Grand County Search and Rescue team rode to the site and interviewed bystanders.

Rider 1 chose the bottom of a small steep slope to set a turnaround track. He was unable to make the turn and jumped off his snowmobile. After landing in the snow, he was hit by an avalanche and fully buried. One of his arms was buried near his chest. He could wiggle that arm and punch it through to the surface. This created an air space. He continued to move his arm until he made enough space to call for help on his radio.

Skier 1 wore an airbag pack, transceiver, and helmet. He also carried a shovel and probe. When the skier decided to descend into the NE Bowl on Powderhouse Peak, he was likely the fourth person to do so. The newest track, likely belonging to skier 1, traversed across the top of the slope more to the east in what appeared to be an attempted ski cut. At the end of the ski cut, the track turned downhill and disappeared over the crown of the avalanche. The other three tracks, two made by snowboards and one by skis, were clustered together and entered the bowl approximately 12 meters (40 feet) west of skier 1. These tracks appeared older, but still recent. They also disappeared over the crown of the avalanche. 

The avalanche caught skier 1 and carried him downslope over rocks and through trees. When the avalanche stopped about 200 meters (650 feet) downhill from where it started, skier 1 was buried on the uphill side of a tree, 1.4 meters (4.5 feet) deep in avalanche debris. His helmet showed severe damage, and he had other significant signs of trauma. Skier 1’s airbag trigger was still zipped up inside the shoulder strap of his pack, and his airbag was not deployed. Skier 1 did not survive.

Skier 1 was reported missing around 4:30 pm, and some of his friends went to Powderhouse Peak to search for him. They saw the avalanche crown and ascended to the toe of the avalanche debris before dark. They initiated a transceiver search, located the position of skier 1, and dug skier 1’s body out of the avalanche debris.

By the time skier 1’s friends finished digging his body out of the debris, night had fallen. Due to the hazard presented by the portion of the slope above them that had not avalanched and the onset of darkness, the group of skier 1’s friends exited the avalanche runout zone. They left skier 1’s body where it had been uncovered. They left his transceiver on in SEND mode. Members of the El Dorado County Search and Rescue team accompanied them back to the parking area. 

The following day, the El Dorado County Sheriff's Office mobilized the SAR team, deputies, and a helicopter to recover skier 1’s body. Forecasters from the Sierra Avalanche Center assisted with onsite snowpack assessment. The El Dorado County Sheriff's Office enlisted the help of the Caltrans Echo Summit Avalanche Control Team who used explosives to mitigate the remaining avalanche hazard lingering above the victim's location. The SAR team then entered the debris field and worked with the helicopter to extract the body of skier 1.

The avalanche consisted of two crowns connected by a persistent weak layer of facets under a dense 1 to 1.2-meter-deep slab (see pit profile and photos for details). It appeared that shooting cracks extended across the slightly lower-angle terrain between the two crowns. The avalanche started on a NE aspect at about 2780 meters (9120 feet). It ran downhill for about 200 meters (650 feet) through trees and over rocks. The slope angle in the starting zone ranged from 38 to 40°. A similar avalanche occurred in this bowl in March of 2020. The NE Bowl of Powderhouse holds complex terrain with several potential start zones that converge into the runout zone of the bowl. The bowl also has numerous trees and rocks that can magnify the consequences of an avalanche. 

Thank you to all the entities whose efforts resulted in a safe and successful recovery: El Dorado County Sheriff's Deputies and Pilots, El Dorado County Search and Rescue Team, and Caltrans Echo Summit Avalanche Control Team. 

Our condolences go out to the victim's family and friends and all those affected by this tragic accident."

Approximately an hour later, LifeFlight arrived and provided Warren with a rescue pack(containing a beacon, shovel, and probe). Despite efforts to locate a beacon signal, Warren was unsuccessful.

Patrollers from Powder Mountain and two avalanche rescue dogs arrived at about 4:45 PM and began a hasty search using dogs, beacons, and probes. Additional search and rescue teams from Rich, Weber, and Cache counties joined the effort. A rescue dog alerted ten feet uphill from where Scott was buried. The rescue team probed the area near the alert and around the nearby tree (where Scott was) but got no strikes. They continued with grid-based probe lines, and someone noticed the smell of gasoline during this time. They re-directed the probe line and got a strike on his snowmobile, which was buried about 3 to 4 feet deep.

The group left the trailhead at 9:40 am with the intention of skiing the lower-angled terrain on the southeast face of Breccia Peak. Thirty-six-year-old Kenny Goff led off, following the established skin track to Breccia for a short distance then switched routes to avoid a stream crossing. They continued east roughly following the summer trail towards Brooks Lake Peak. Soon, they found themselves far to the east of their intended route to Breccia. The group stopped and consulted their mapping apps and discussed whether to traverse towards Breccia or go back down. The group looked at their mapping apps and saw a way to contour around the bowl north of Radio Tower Peak that avoided steep terrain. Goff continued to lead the way through the forested slopes beneath the shoulder of the peak, roughly following the route of the summer trail to Brooks Lake Mountain. (Fig 4) 

After ¾ mile, the route emerged into more open terrain beneath steeper slopes, and the group spread out for safer travel. Within a few hundred feet, the terrain becomes more alpine in nature, with cliffs and sparse patches of fir trees. Visibility was marginal, with light snowfall and flat light. The group began to cross a gully, first Goff, then skier 2, with skier 3 and 4 hanging back in a patch of trees (Fig 5). Goff was almost across the main gully, with skier 2 a short distance behind, when the slope collapsed with an audible thud. Skier 3 shuffled backward into the safety of the patch of trees with skier 4. Skier 2 saw the slope fail, and saw his friend move downslope in the debris while he attempted to escape toward the edge of the gully though he was soon engulfed in debris as well. The flow somehow pushed him across the top of the bulk of the debris and buried him 20 feet up the drainage, skiers right (east) of Goff.

Skiers 3 and 4 began to search and spotted what appeared to be a glove or article of clothing which they found to be skier 2’s hand. Skier 3 uncovered skier 2’s face then began to dig him out. Meanwhile, skier 4 had acquired a signal though he was initially confused at the high numbers on the screen. They soon realized the beacon was working normally but the high number was due to the 4.2-meter depth of burial. Skier three began digging for Goff. At 11:32 am, skier 4 texted 911 via a new phone with satellite-to-911 capabilities that an avalanche accident had occurred. By 11:46 am, the injured skier was completely excavated. The group then put all of their efforts into digging for Goff while occasionally taking breaks to text more information to the 911 operator. They dug through the hard debris for an hour and a half. Once they reached their friend, they were forced to dig horizontally to free him from his skis and finally lift him out of what was now a 13-foot-deep hole. Skiers 3 and 4 reported that they had begun CPR at 1:04 pm and continued until 2:37 pm. Rescuers from TCSAR arrived on the scene at 4:00 pm and packaged Skier 2 in a rescue toboggan and skied him to a waiting ambulance. The rescue crew returned in the dark to bring out Goff. "

He was soon caught, carried, and buried twenty feet deep in the avalanche and unfortunately did not survive. Another party skiing the terrain to the south in Little Cottonwood Canyon noticed a single track into fresh avalanche debris and called Alta Central.

This single track dropped off the north side of the ridge into upper Silver Fork, on the rider's right side of Davenport Hill. The reporting party couldn’t see where the track exited but did see the track covered over by avalanche debris a couple hundred feet below the ridge.

At approximately 12:00 PM, a witness reported the incident to Alta Central, initiating a coordinated response from search teams, including AirMed, DPS, the Utah Department of Transportation, Salt Lake Search and Rescue, Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, Alta Ski Area, and the Utah Avalanche Center.

By early afternoon, search teams opted to use a long-range receiver already in the air following recovery operations from a <a href=""https://utahavalanchecenter.org/avalanche/90994"">nearby fatality in Porter Fork</a>. The receiver detected a faint signal, leading Wasatch Backcountry Rescue to survey the area and assess the terrain from the air. Their observations revealed a distinct track entering the avalanche debris without any sign of exit, combined with the signal, strongly suggesting human involvement.

Due to unstable conditions in the surrounding avalanche terrain and the heightened risk of secondary slides, teams determined that initial avalanche mitigation would be required before safely deploying rescuers."

To further complicate the picture, avalanche danger prevented avalanche forecasters from accessing the accident site and avalanche information is either estimated or conjectured via photos, snowpack history, and discussions with search and rescue personnel.

On Saturday, December 28th, a backcountry skier in Porter Fork found an unattended dog wandering in the drainage.

On Sunday, December 29, Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Department, and Salt Lake County Search and Rescue (SLCOSAR) started an investigation for a missing person. They also received reports of an out-of-state van that had been unattended for a couple of days in the Porter Fork parking lot. The microchip on the dog’s collar and license plate data provided information on the owner and the dog’s tracks through the mountains. Cell phone “pings” targeted by the cell phone provider also provided some GPS information to narrow the search areas within Porter Fork further. Ground teams searched cabins in the lower portions of the drainage for the individual. In the afternoon, a backcountry skier (we'll call him The Good Samaritan). who commonly skis in the area saw the Sheriff’s social media post and remembered seeing an avalanche debris pile just below Porter Fork Pass and the western slope of Mt Raymond.

On Monday, December 30, while ground teams searched the low to mid-elevation areas in Porter Fork, investigators used social media to inquire about any sightings of the missing individual in that area. The avalanche danger was rated as HIGH, limiting search areas from the ground. A helicopter armed with a long-range receiver flew over likely search areas but did not detect any transmissions. By late afternoon, acting on his hunch, The Good Samaritan and a partner traveled up to Main Porter Fork to the debris pile, conducted a beacon search, and uncovered the victim, who by this time had most likely been buried for nearly 36 hours. The Good Samaritan returned to the trailhead by 6 PM to alert the SAR teams.

On Tuesday, December 31, SLCOSAR teams utilized Utah Department of Public Safety and Life Flight helicopters to insert two rescuers and a spotter to the ridge above the accident site. An hour before, avalanche mitigation teams flew in and dropped explosives to trigger avalanches to make the area safe for rescue teams. The explosives triggered four avalanches in the area, giving rescuers room to conduct the extraction of the body to the Incident Command Post in the valley.

As the individual was traveling solo (other than with his dog), only conjecture can offer any sort of narrative of the chain of events. David Ethier, thirty-eight years old and hailing from Quebec, Canada, was on a road trip in the western US with his dog. Research indicates he was a mountain athlete and backcountry snowboarder. David had climbed Mt Olympus in the Wasatch the day before the accident. On Saturday, December 28, David began his outing into Porter Fork of Millcreek Canyon, proceeding up Main Porter Fork to reach Porter Fork Pass at 9,300'. It was reported that other tracks were in the area and perhaps, wanting more fresh tracks, he ascended the ridge to the east to gain more elevation. At this point, David put his splitboard together, stowed his ski poles, and rode down his chosen line. We do not know anything about how the avalanche was triggered. All we know, is that they were caught, carried, and buried in an avalanche. Photographs from the site indicate a soft slab of wind-drifted snow, perhaps 1-2 feet deep and 70 feet wide, that likely failed on a persistent weak layer of faceted grains. This was on a steep northwest-facing slope at 9400’. His black lab was found by another backcountry skier later in the afternoon of December 28."

<p>Skier 1 descended along the ridgeline above the Mines 2 avalanche path. He made “one or two” turns into the top of Mines 2. He did not intend to ski the slope and only wanted to check the snow conditions. He saw a large crack shoot out in front of him and an avalanche break above him. He took a hard left turn and skied off the moving snow. Another wave of moving snow hit him from above and carried him down the slope.</p>
<p>The avalanche dragged Skier 1 through small trees lower on the slope. He “swam” and kept his feet and skis oriented downhill. The avalanche eventually dragged him under, and he lost both skis. During the avalanche, Skier 1 knew that ""when the debris slowed down, it was my chance to try and fight and get my head above the snow."" When the debris stopped, Skier 1’s arms were out of the snow but his face and head were buried by about six inches of debris (partially buried - critical). Despite suffering a dislocated shoulder in the avalanche, Skier 1 was able to dig himself out of the debris and call 911 on his cell phone. The avalanche had swept him about 400 vertical feet through small trees, and he came to rest about three-quarters of the way down the avalanche path.</p>

On that day around 5:00 AM, they began hiking with a friend, 23, up the Sawmill trail to access the Big Willow Drainage. They intended to use the Big Willow Aprons as an approach to Lone Peak. Earlier that morning, they left a car parked in Little Cottonwood Canyon near the Y Couloir which they planned to ski as a final run at the end of the day. Their tour was on the heels of a significant, late season storm that left up to two feet of new snow in the mountains between Sunday and Tuesday. Their friend had skied with Andrew on Monday. He also skied on Tuesday, and Wednesday in Little Cottonwood Canyon. His assessment was that the snowpack seemed to be stabilizing, particularly by Wednesday.</p>
<p>The group of three started hiking in running shoes for about 2 miles then switched to skis when they got to the snow. By around 8:30 AM, they had reached the bottom of Big Willow Cirque where the friend joined a work meeting on his phone. Austin and Andrew continued breaking trail ahead. After his meeting, the friend caught up to his partners and they ascended together. They skinned as far as they could and eventually began to boot pack (hike on foot) approximately 150’ vertical below the ridge. The friend took the boot pack lead and began “wallowing” in deep snow up the slope. The old snow was still soft, and he remembers not feeling any supportable layer under the new snow. He noticed a very thin wind-affected layer on the surface of the snow, but no indications of wind loading (past or current) or other obvious signs of instability. They were moving diagonally up the slope about 100’ vertical below the ridge, and the friend crossed to the looker’s right side of the fin (locations marked in the photo below). At 9:44 AM (according to his GPS watch*), he took 4-5 more steps, and the avalanche broke above and around him.</p>
<p>The friend was knocked off his feet and tumbled head over heels, cartwheeling down the slope, for approximately 300 vertical feet. When the snow stopped moving, he was sitting upright, partially buried with his right arm free and left arm covered in snow. He took off his glasses because he couldn’t see, coughed up snow, and dug himself out. At the time, he thought he was the only one caught and believed Austin and Andrew were waiting for him on the other side of the fin (looker’s left). He skied down to the bottom of the fin, turned around the base, and saw the other side (looker’s left) had avalanched even bigger.</p>
<p>He immediately yelled for his partners and turned his transceiver to receive. He did not have a signal until he skied down within transmitting range of his friends’ transceivers. After acquiring a signal, he noticed a ski on top of the avalanche debris and moved towards it. About 13 minutes (according to his GPS watch*) after the avalanche occurred, he probed and struck Austin on the second try. He partially dug Austin out, gave a few rescue breaths, but got no response. He cleared more snow away from Austin’s chest, hoping he would spontaneously start to breathe. He then turned his focus to finding Andrew, who was still buried.</p>
<p>The friend hit the flag button on his transceiver to silence Austin’s signal so he could hear Andrew’s. He was confused for 1-2 minutes because his transceiver displayed a strong signal 44m away from him. This distance reading didn’t make sense because some of Austin and Andrew’s gear was visible on the slope near him, but he initially moved away following the directions on his transceiver. However, the readings on his transceiver steered him back towards Austin. He flagged Austin’s signal again, acquired Andrew’s signal which was nearby, and started a fine search. As he started this search, he noticed a glove poking through the snow. He dug near the glove but didn’t find anything so he performed a fine search again. He probed twice and found Andrew. He uncovered his head, cleared his airway, and performed rescue breaths, but Andrew did not start breathing. He called 911 at 10:18 AM, and continued to unbury his partners while waiting for help to arrive, but stopped, as he believed they were dead.</p>
<p>*Times are from the friend’s GPS watch, giving us a reasonably accurate timeline, but there was a flaw in the data the moment the avalanche occurred.</p>"

On the morning of April 8, he planned a day of fieldwork for the Center. He planned to collect information on the development of Wind Slab avalanche conditions in the area and evaluate the sensitivity of a persistent weak layer in the snowpack. He submitted a trip plan that included his route, return time, goals for the day, potential hazards, and how he would manage his risk. He reviewed his trip plan with another CAIC forecaster as required by the Center’s field safety plan. He left the Herman Gulch trailhead at 10:30 AM, ascending the east ridge of Mount Bethel on skis. He reached treeline around noon and spent the next hour digging snow profiles and investigating snowpack conditions.</p>
<p>Worker 1 found stiff wind-drifted snow over a hard melt-freeze crust. The underlying snowpack showed signs of rounding and strengthening and was moist throughout. Snowpack tests produced moderate failures under the recently drifted snow (see profile image).</p>
<p>He finished his observations and began a slow downward traverse. He followed a low-angled gully (20 to 25 degrees) northward toward the valley bottom and the Herman Gulch trail. At approximately 1:30 PM, Worker 1 heard a loud booming collapse as an avalanche broke about 40 feet above him. He attempted to ski out of the moving debris, which consisted of large hard snow blocks. He deployed his avalanche airbag before losing a ski. He turned to the skier’s right and tried to ski out of the avalanche on one ski. The avalanche knocked him off his feet and swept him approximately 50 vertical feet downhill. When the avalanche stopped, Worker 1 was partially buried, pinned against several trees in an upright sitting position with his legs, lower torso, and left arm buried under the snow.</p>"

According to a self recorded video, as he neared the crater rim, this was his 28th summit of the peak. He also alluded to the potential danger of large cornices along the ridge. The climber then sat down his pack and unstrapped from his board. Footprints lead from the gear toward a clear fresh cornice fracture suggesting he spent little time on top before the accident. 

The cornice carried the victim several hundred vertical feet over cliffs and extremely steep snow slopes. It then triggered a large slab avalanche below (Image 1 and Image 2). In total the climber traveled twelve hundred vertical feet in the initial avalanche. It appears he came to rest near the toe of the debris (Image 3).

Separated from his gear and communication devices, he attempted to ascend the crater walls back to the rim. Visible footprints leave the initial debris pile (Image 3), ascend nearby terrain (Image 2), and traverse several slopes east of the initial slide (Image 4). After exploring several potential routes, the climber ascended behind and then onto a short very steep sub-ridge just below the crater rim (Image 4). 

It is on this feature we believe the climber triggered a second avalanche either in wind-loaded snow or attempting to climb the final cornice. This second slide carried him once again over cliffs and very steep snow slopes (Image 4). Marks on the snow below suggest the impact of a large object, potentially a chunk of cornice or the climber himself. These marks form a clear fall line from where the avalanche is believed to have initiated and his final resting place. 

There is no clear evidence that the climber moved after coming to rest from the second avalanche. Localized wind-blown snow in the areas covered the climber's face and parts of his upper body. This wind-drifted area also likely obscured most of avalanche debris and any small pieces of the cornice.

They planned to ski a slope locally known as the Birthday Chute. They intended to climb to and descend from a small group of trees where the couloir splits into a “Y” around 11,500 feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They left the trailhead at 6:30 AM and skinned up Pitkin Creek to the bottom of the Birthday Chute. They ascended through the trees to the south of the chute. Around 11,000 feet, they left the forest and ascended directly up the couloir to the small group of trees. They decided to ascend a little further. When they began to move beyond the small group of trees, they triggered the avalanche above them.</p>
<p>At first, they thought it was a small slide that would only wash over their skis, but the avalanche propagated widely, and they could not escape. The avalanche caught both skiers and the dog and swept them 2000 vertical feet down the couloir to the valley floor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skier 1 was partially buried-critical with his head under the snow, but he was able to free himself from the debris. His arm was injured, and he lost one ski in the avalanche but was otherwise mobile. He saw Skier 2 was on the surface of the debris. Skier 2 had an injured leg and hand and was unable to move. Skier 1 saw the dog with its head buried and dug it out of the snow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither skier could find their cell phones. Their emergency satellite communicator was out of batteries. Skier 1 made Skier 2 as comfortable as possible and skied back towards the trailhead on one ski. Partway back, Skier 1 encountered a hiker and used the hiker’s phone to call 911. By the time Skier 1 made it back to the trailhead, a rescue team was preparing to head into the field.</p>
<p>A CAIC forecaster and two volunteers were doing fieldwork on the southeast ridge of Outpost Peak, across the valley from Birthday Chute. One of the volunteers is a member of Vail Mountain Rescue Group (VMRG). The fieldwork team noted the recent avalanche in the Birthday Chute. Not long after, the VMRG member received notification of the accident. The VMRG member notified the incident commander that he was in the area, and the group made their way to Skier 2’s location, where they assessed Skier 2’s condition and provided first aid. Other members of VMRG arrived. A Colorado Army National Guard helicopter hoisted Skier 2 from the site and transferred him to hospital care. Ground teams carried the dog back to the trailhead.&nbsp;</p>"

They were planning to ski on a slope seen from the road that they had not been to before. Knowing there were strong winds along the ridgetops, they were hoping to find soft snow in sheltered terrain that was not steep enough to slide. All skiers had a minimum of Level 1 avalanche training and between 6-10 years of backcountry skiing experience.</p>
<p>As the skiers ascended they used their ski poles to probe the snowpack and their hands to perform quick ‘hand pits’. These are common informal tests to assess the snowpack layering and stability in the top foot of the snowpack. The skiers noted soft settled powder with some areas having a slightly stiffer ‘couple of inches’ of snow on top. They attributed this to either warming or wind. The party did not observe any signs of instability in the snowpack where they were traveling. They had read the Weekend Avalanche Outlook for this area (issued 4 days prior) as well as the Turnagain Pass avalanche forecast issued that morning. They were aware of a buried weak layer that existed region-wide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The skiers continued skinning in a switchback fashion up the slope to where it began to get steeper. At this point the skiers decided to spread out so there was space between them. The snow surface was still soft without signs of wind loading. All three had avalanche airbags and they proceeded to arm them. Skier 3 took out their inclinometer and measured a slope angle in the low 30s with what appeared to be slightly steeper terrain further up the slope. Not wanting to be on steeper slopes, the group decided to head to a treed subridge, to the north, with a lower slope angle. As they made their way across the upper section of the slope to this safer spot they heard a loud crack. Skiers 1 and 3 recall looking up and seeing a large wave of snow about to overtake them. They reported not having time to turn their skis or attempt to get out of the way. All three were caught. Skiers 1 and 3 were carried for 25 to 30 seconds traveling ~1,300’ down the slope through patches of trees and alders (~600’ vertical distance). Skier 2 was caught in a small stand of trees higher on the slope and traveled ~500’ (~150’ vertical distance). Skier 3 describes having difficulty pulling their airbag due to the turbulent flow; it ultimately did not inflate. Skiers 1 and 2 were also unsuccessful in deploying their airbags. All three skiers were wearing avalanche transceivers and had probes and shovels in their packs.</p>"

The pair had ridden together regularly. The two had discussed avalanche concerns and had chosen to stay off steep slopes, especially slopes in the alpine areas nearby. During the morning, they had ridden on lower angled, treed slopes and observed no signs of instability like cracking in the snow surface. The two rode slowly to avoid rocks and small trees in the wide, low angle drainage bottom and soon regrouped. After rider one started riding downhill about ten feet away, rider two noticed the failure of the slope. He immediately hit the throttle but was captured briefly by the debris and able to remain upright. Meanwhile, the lead rider was knocked off his snowmachine before the debris stopped moving about 20’ past his track. The second rider circled back and parked his machine at the edge of the debris about 30 feet away. He shouted out to his buried companion who managed to kick his foot above the snow. Rider two walked and crawled through the debris and began to dig with hands. He soon uncovered a waving hand which he tried to pull, first with his hands then he dug down further to lock elbows for better pruchase and pulled again. At this point, he realized he would need to dig with a shovel and returned to his machine, where his shovel was strapped to a bag on the top of his tunnel bag. He broke away the accumulated ice and pried off his frozen shovel and again crawled over the loose and blocky debris to his friend. Digging quickly to his friend's face, he discovered that he had stopped breathing and was pulseless. He dug further to expose enough of him that he could pull him out of the snow to begin CPR. He began CPR but was unable to revive his companion. He then used his SPOT device to summon help. (Fig 4, 5)</p>"

They planned to ride towards an area known as ""Mushy Park"" and snowmobile through low-angle meadows. The group completed a trailhead check of avalanche equipment, discussed avalanche conditions, and agreed they should avoid all avalanche terrain.</p>
<p>They found deeper snow and decreased visibility as they gained elevation. They decided to ride in a large meadow in Middle Creek, east of Priest Mountain. They discussed a steep slope to avoid. Rider 1 recalled being unable to identify individual terrain features and being constantly surprised by bumps and small hills. Another rider said the contrast was so poor he could not make out terrain features ten feet in front.</p>
<p>Rider 1 thought she was avoiding the steep slope but realized she was climbing a much steeper slope than planned. She turned downhill as her sled started to trench, but was thrown off the snowmobile. The sled landed on her, pushing her deeper into the snow. She did not know she was in an avalanche until she felt the flowing snow and the debris piling onto her. She stopped moving in seconds, fully buried in the avalanche debris. Her radio was pinned near her head, and she could hear the group's radio traffic. She could not move aside from wriggling her right foot. She lost consciousness within minutes.</p>
<p>Riders 2 and 3 were nearby and watched as Rider 1 rode up the steep slope and began trenching. They saw the slope fracture around her and Rider 1 fall into the avalanche as it started flowing downhill. They radioed ""avalanche, avalanche"" to the group. Rider 2 assembled his probe and began probing. Rider 3 began a transceiver search. He followed the signal and stepped on Rider 1's foot just a few inches below the snow surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Riders 2 and 3 left their packs with their sleds when they began the rescue and did not have their shovels. They began digging with their hands. The rest of the group arrived and used the conveyor belt method to excavate Rider 1, with one person shoveling in the front, one person clearing the snow from behind them, and one person on standby to switch in every minute or so.</p>
<p>They reached Rider 1's airway five to six minutes after the avalanche. Rider 5 cleared avalanche debris from her airway, and Rider 1 began breathing and regained consciousness in about 30 seconds. They built a fire, warmed Rider 1, and assessed her condition. It took the group about 20 minutes to excavate Rider 1's snowmobile, which was completely buried a few feet from her.

Ski Hayden Peak is a local name for a point 13,316, a subpeak north of Hayden Peak. Skier 2 joined in a “last-minute decision” that morning. The two skiers arrived at the trailhead around 11:00 AM. They followed a standard route up Sawyer Creek. Skier 1 mentioned the track they were following was filled by recent snow and obscured by the time they reached 11,000 feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without a track to follow, Skier 1 chose a route similar to one he had traveled a year prior. Skier 2 recalls stopping for a few seconds before they began climbing a steeper slope to put on her ski pole wrist straps. Shortly after, Skier 2 heard Skier 1 shout, looked up, and saw an avalanche coming right at them.</p>
<p>The avalanche hit the skiers before either could attempt to get out of the way. The avalanche knocked Skier 1 off his feet, carried him 50 to 100 feet downhill, and tore his skis off. When the avalanche stopped, he was partially buried with his head above the snow. Skier 1 dug himself free within a minute and looked for Skier 2.</p>
<p>The avalanche buried Skier 2, but the tip of her ski pole was above the debris (partially buried-critical). Skier 1 saw the pole, ran over, and swiftly found Skier 2’s hand a few inches under the debris. Skier 1 dug with his avalanche shovel and quickly cleared Skier 2’s airway. Her head was buried about two feet deep. It took about 10 minutes to dig her completely free of the debris.</p>

The pair gained the ridge, noting one collapse in the snowpack along the way, and headed east to the top of a sub-ridge of Little Poudre Mountain. The ridge is exposed to wind, and the pair found stiff, wind-hammered snow from moderate to strong winds two days prior which was now capped with soft snow. The pair made a quick plan to ski for a few hundred feet and regroup below a patch of trees to plan the next pitch of skiing. (Fig 8) Skier 1 told Skier 2 to follow his tracks, stay on the ridge, and then began skiing. Seconds later, Skier 2 followed. Skier 1 skied fast, his normal style, but soon noticed avalanche debris flowing in the gully to his left. He stopped on a high point on the ridge and planned to descend towards the debris pile first along the main ridge to avoid the bushes and trees in the gully and potential hang-fire above (Fig 9 and 10). He descended to where debris began to accumulate and initiated a beacon search. He acquired a signal 1.2m beneath the surface and quickly dug to expose his friend lying face up, head downhill. Skier 1 noted no signs of impact to his friend's helmet but later noted an angulated leg fracture. He also noted no ice mask or snow in the mouth. He found no carotid pulse or signs of breathing and began CPR, which he continued for one and a half hours.&nbsp;An autopsy would later rule that the cause of death was asphyxia.</p>"

The trio made plans the evening prior through a Zoom video call, emphasizing the objective of the day was to seek out safe skiing options. On the morning of the incident, while in route to the Trailhead, they reviewed the IPAC avalanche forecast and decided to ski conservative terrain.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the Trailhead, the group encountered an IPAC Avalanche Forecaster preparing for a day in the field. A brief discussion about conditions took place. All three skiers were equipped with suitable gear for winter mountain travel, including beacons, shovels, probes, airbags, and the knowledge of their operation. They had checked and practiced with their avalanche equipment earlier in the season. Additionally, each skier had undergone avalanche training, possessed familiarity with the terrain, and were experienced backcountry skiers.</p>
<p>Departing from the trailhead at 3,500 feet, the group ascended the lower Lone Lake drainage, establishing a skin track on the west side to reach the west ridge, just south of West Willow Peak (6,302 feet). At 12:14 PM, they descended their first run off the ridge on the east-facing slope adjacent to their up track. Following the initial lap, they continued up the ridge to the south, intending to ski further up the drainage with a similar slope angle, aspect, and elevation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On their second descent, the skiers chose a slope with varying angles and intermittent islands of trees. The initial 200 vertical feet was approximately 27-degrees steep. Negotiating this section, the trio regrouped above a pitch where the slope angle increased. Adhering to standard safety practices, they descended one at a time. Skier 1 descended approximately 400 vertical feet then radioed from a presumed safe location to Skier 2 that they were clear to begin their decent.</p>
<p>During Skier 2's descent at 2:00 PM, a small, localized avalanche, around a foot deep, was triggered. This quickly stepped down approximately 2.5 ft to a buried facet/crust combo, approximately 6 inches from ground, that propagated extensively to the sides and above. The avalanche caught Skiers 1 and 2, with Skier 3 witnessing the event from above and promptly initiating a search.</p>
<p>Utilizing a beacon search, Skier 3 located Skier 2, whose airbag was deployed and visible on the surface. Skier 2 was found in the trees, fall line from his last seen point. Skier 3 dug out Skier 2, finding Skier 2’s body pinned against a tree, cleared his airway, but found no signs of life.</p>
<p>Skier 1 was carried in the avalanche debris and came to rest near the avalanche's toe. Skier 1 successfully deployed his airbag while being carried by the slide. Managing to extricate himself, Skier 1 identified a broken forearm. Skier 1 communicated verbally with Skier 3 and, at 2:18 PM, sent an SOS message using a Garmin InReach which was relayed to the Shoshone County Sheriff’s office and the Shoshone County Search &amp; Rescue team. Skiers 1 and 3 initially attempted to build a shelter to get warm, however, facing cold temperatures, they decided to move towards the trailhead. The route out was complicated by deep, cohesionless snow, and Skier 1's loss of skis and poles in the avalanche.</p>"

They chose Current Creek because they knew the terrain well. They read the CAIC avalanche forecasts for many days prior, and Rider 2 checked the forecast on December 5. They understood the avalanche danger and the potential to trigger avalanches from a distance. They planned to avoid traveling near steep slopes and “use the terrain to their advantage” by avoiding gullies and traveling on higher ground. They planned to ascend Current Creek to a tiny knoll below Moonlight Basin.</p>
<p>They skinned through soft snow below treeline. As they neared the treeline, they noticed stiffer layers in the snowpack and observed more signs of instability, like cracking and collapsing. They saw recent avalanches in the area.</p>
<p>Skier 1 reached the knoll. Rider 2 was about 10 feet behind, just below the knoll. They felt the snowpack collapse and saw an avalanche release in Moonlight Basin. They wondered aloud if the slide could reach them, initially thinking it would not. As the powder cloud grew, Rider 2 yelled, “come to me” and Skier 1 began to turn downhill.</p>
<p>A blast of rushing air ahead of the avalanche was soon followed by moving snow. The avalanche blew Skier 1 off the knoll and five to ten feet downhill, only a few feet from Rider 2. The avalanche knocked Rider 2 down. Rider 2 was wearing an avalanche airbag, but it was not armed. The pair were shaken but not buried or injured. Skier 1 lost some equipment in the avalanche. They came to rest on top of the snow surface, close to the edge of the debris pile.</p>
<p>The pair followed their route back to the trailhead. They notified the Grand County Sheriff's office about the avalanche and informed the dispatcher they did not require help. Rider 2 shared information about their incident with the Colorado Avalanche Information Center the following day.</p>"

Based on communications with their friend, the team had intended to climb the route in a single, long push. As is typical, to minimize weight and move fast, they did not take overnight gear, nor likely more than a day’s supply of food, water, and fuel.</p>
<p>Search efforts began Sunday, May 7 after a concerned friend alerted park officials that the team had not checked back via InReach following their climb. These efforts continued through Thursday, May 11 after which the search was scaled back. Clues collected by mountaineering rangers throughout the search indicate that the climbers were swept off their feet by a small slab avalanche on the evening of Friday, May 5, high on the peak’s West Ridge route. Several items of the climbers’ equipment, including two ice axes, were observed off the climbing route during aerial searches of the 3,200-foot fall line. Multiple ground searches of the heavily crevassed glacier at the bottom of the fall line were conducted via helicopter short-haul in order to reduce exposure to rockfall and avalanche hazards to rescuers. The two climbers were not found.</p>
<p>Spotters on aerial and ground missions searched both the climbing route and the fall line to the degree that if the climbers were visible on the surface, there is a high probability they would have been discovered. Considering the severity of the rocky terrain along the 3,200-foot fall line, the team’s limited supplies, temperatures ranging from 5 F to 20 F overnight, and the duration of time since last contact, search managers have concluded that survival is outside the window of possibility. </p>

Both groups had planned to ride into the same area. They decided to break trail as one group, switching their family band radios to a common channel before leaving the trailhead. Some group members previously knew each other, but they were not frequent riding partners. The new group consisted of five males and one female. All were advanced to expert riders. The members of the victim’s group will be referred to as Riders 1 (age 35), 2 (age 43), and 3 (age 29). The members of the other group will be referred to as Riders 4 (age 29), 5 (age 29), and 6 (age 27). </p>
<p>The group’s route initially followed the path of a summer road and then a summer trail. After approximately 8 miles, they left the summer trail and followed ridges and gullies leading up to the large, gently-sloping basin on the NE side of Observation Peak (9,151’). The riders took turns breaking trail, occasionally getting stuck and stopping to get unstuck while other riders leapfrogged ahead. </p>
<p>As the group climbed toward the lake, Rider 6 got stuck and Riders 4 and 5 stopped to assist. Riders 1, 2, and 3 continued up toward the small lake 500 feet below the summit of the peak. At this point in the day, the group had not seen any recent avalanches or experienced any obvious signs of instability.</p>
<p>Once at the lake, Riders 1, 2, and 3 stopped below the final climb that leads to the east ridge of Observation Peak (Figs 2, 3, and 5). Rider 1 executed a climbing sidehill to gain the ridge, crossing the slope that would eventually avalanche. Rider 1 stopped on the ridge and watched as Rider 2 successfully made the same climb, stopping near Rider 1. Rider 3 followed roughly the same route as Riders 1 and 2 watched. Rider 3 had almost completed the climb when the avalanche released. Simultaneously, Riders 1 and 2 turned to continue riding toward the summit above, thinking that Rider 3 had made it across the climb safely.  </p>
<p>At the same time, Riders 4, 5, and 6 successfully got Rider 6 unstuck. Riders 2 and 4 both had GPS systems equipped on their snowmobiles which allowed them to see each other’s location. Rider 4 used this to navigate towards Rider 2, with Riders 5 and 6 following behind. As they approached the location indicated by the onboard GPS, Rider 4 noticed a large, fresh avalanche. The debris from the avalanche was still moving when Rider 4 arrived. </p>
<p>Rider 4 rode to the toe of the debris and immediately got on the radio, indicating that there was a “big slide, big slide”, and asking if Riders 1, 2, and 3 were clear. At this point, Riders 1 and 2 thought that their group was clear, and they reported that over the radio to Rider 4. A photo taken at this point is timestamped 12:22 PM. </p>
<p>Rider 4 could only see two tracks exiting the crown. He turned his transceiver to search and immediately got a signal of 60 meters, leading towards the debris. He instructed everyone to turn their transceivers to search mode and began following the signal, calling out the numbers reported by his transceiver as they did. Riders 5 and 6 followed. On the surface, there was no evidence of Rider 3 or his snowmobile. Concurrently, Riders 1 and 2 realized that they were missing Rider 3, and they turned around and rode down to the bench above the crown. They were uncertain how to proceed down to the debris without possibly endangering Riders 4, 5, and 6 below, so they initially stayed in their position above the avalanche crown.</p>
<p>Riders 4, 5, and 6 quickly honed in on Rider 3’s transceiver signal, getting a minimum signal of 1.8 m. They were probing to pinpoint the buried victim a few minutes after the avalanche released. They had several probe strikes on the buried snowmobile before successfully striking Rider 3’s body. They began digging, initially finding portions of the snowmobile before finding Rider 3’s helmet. Rider 3 was found face down, with his head below his feet. His head was buried an estimated 6-7 feet deep. </p>
<p>By this point, Riders 1 and 2 had descended the crown of the avalanche onto the slick, firm bed surface. The group worked to extricate Rider 3 from the debris. They removed his helmet and noted his skin was blue. Snow was densely packed into his helmet and airway. Rider 3 needed to be mostly uncovered before he could be pulled from the snow. Rider 3 was placed on a flat surface, and Riders 1, 4, and 5 took turns performing CPR. They continued resuscitation efforts for an estimated 5-10 minutes but were unable to revive him. Resuscitation efforts stopped at 12:41, 19 minutes after the avalanche occurred. The coroner later concluded that Rider 3 died from traumatic injuries that were sustained in the accident.</p>"

Skier 1 led the descent, made ~6 turns, and stopped on a ramp behind a tree on the skiers left side of the couloir (Figure 8).

Earlier in the day the two were riding with their father and went over Daisy Pass to ride in the relatively flat meadows on the north side of Crown Butte. They discussed wind-loading patterns and noted fresh avalanche activity that involved the recent storm snow. All three carried avalanche shovels and probes, Wyatt and their father had airbag packs, and none of them had avalanche beacons. They had read the avalanche forecast that morning and the previous couple days. They also noticed the avalanche danger sign along the snowmobile trail leaving Cooke City showed “MODERATE” that morning.</p>
<p>Early in the afternoon the three came back over Daisy Pass and their father rode back to Cooke City. The brothers stayed out to ride on the south side of Daisy Pass, mostly on relatively low angle, rolling terrain below tree line. Shortly before 3:45 p.m. they were climbing simultaneously on adjacent, but separate slopes, and intended to meet on a bench above an island of trees that separated the slopes. Bryce stopped at the top of the slope, then noticed an avalanche fracture on the other side of the island of trees that split the two slopes. He started his sled and headed to the bottom.</p>
<p>Wyatt had been side hilling towards the spot they intended to meet, following some older tracks, and then went straight up the big, steep slope above the tracks. He was 200’ from the top of the slope when the avalanche released.</p>"

<p>Skier 2 decided that he needed to go back to the ski area for help. He traversed through the trees, yelling for help. There were no other tracks, so he had to break trail through the snow.

The survivor attempted to turn and ride upslope but failed and turned back downhill and entered the forest below the avalanche path to turn around for another attempt at climbing the slope. He was approximately 50 yards from the bottom of the avalanche path. He paused to catch his breath and clear snow from his runners and noted that he no longer heard his partner's sled engine, who he assumed had made it to the top of the slope and was now awaiting him. Unknown to him, his partner had made the hill climb, but had then returned down the slope, triggering the avalanche at a convex roll in the terrain.     </p>"

Three of the five were very familiar with the area having made 10-15 trips each, while this was victim Nathaniel Wolfe’s (age 34) third trip. Each person had a beacon, shovel, probe and avalanche airbag. They all follow the GNFAC’s posts on social media and at least one of them had read the avalanche forecast that morning.</p>
<p>The day was mostly clear and windy and the three snowmobilers and two snow bikers rode up the south side of Sheep Creek to the head of the drainage, playing along the way. They saw no signs of instability. Later in the afternoon they began climbing and boondocking along the north side of the valley on their way back to town. </p>
<p>Near 5 p.m. the two snow bikers, Loren (48) and Nathaniel, climbed up the south side of Miller Mountain, threading their way through trees and gullies to treeline. Loren stopped on a sharp ridge as Nathaniel climbed up further to “a spot where we would normally not go”, according to Bodie (48), another member of the group. Nathaniel triggered the avalanche and Loren saw a “bunch of snow come by me; I couldn’t get him on the radio.” Loren alerted the others over his radio. </p>
<p>Bodie and his son, Junior (14), were down valley and did not see the avalanche. They turned around and rode back to the area looking for avalanche debris. The lower slopes of the area are characterized by many trees and gullies that made it difficult to quickly identify the runout zone. Jason (40) was up valley with a separate group of riders when he got the radio call about the avalanche. Because the avalanche was funneled down a narrow gully and over a small cliff (a waterfall in the summer) the debris was only 75-100 feet wide but up to 15 feet deep in spots. </p>"

His brother rode up the hill from the bottom of Denny Creek when he saw avalanche debris and Rider 1’s flipped sled. Further upslope he spotted orange fabric from a deflated airbag against a tree. He made his way over on sled and foot. It is undetermined if Rider 1 deployed the airbag or if the zipper opened and spilled the fabric out of the pack. The bright color signaled his location. The brother estimates 10-15 minutes passed from when the avalanche was triggered to when he saw it. It took him another 5-10 minutes to reach and uncover his brother.

<p>The first call to 911 was made at 2:49pm.  </p>
<p>Teton County Idaho Search and Rescue (TCISAR) called to Teton County Wyoming (TCSAR) and Madison County Idaho for assistance.</p>
<p>Teton County Idaho Search and Rescue was the first on scene, arriving at 4:10 pm via Air Idaho Rescue helicopter.  Teton County Search and Rescue (Wyoming) was called to assist and arrived via helicopter at 4:18pm.  Madison County Search and Rescue provided ground support from the Green Canyon trailhead and was not involved in the accident site search.  When rescuers first arrived on the scene the other group members were present. In the time between the avalanche and the arrival of rescuers, one of the victim’s fathers and three other friends had also arrived to the scene.  When rescuers arrived, Skier 1 had already been extricated from the snow.  He was assumed to be the skier, as he had ski boots on.  He was located adjacent to and uphill of the buried snowmobile.  He was on the surface of the snow and unattended when rescuers arrived.  A TCSAR member attended to Skier 1 to assess him medically and determined that the victim showed “no signs of life”.  The TCSAR medical director issued guidance to the field team to forgo resuscitation efforts based on the patient assessment and medical protocols.  TCISAR initiated a search with two K9 rescue dogs though the dogs did not locate adequate scent to alert strongly to handlers. After clearing the debris pile of snowmobiles and people, TCSAR started a probe line of 7 rescuers uphill of the snowmobile in an area weakly indicated by K9 rescue dog Mikko.  Snowmobiler 1 was found by probe line at 5:26 pm, 10-15 minutes after the probe line was initiated. </p>
<p>He was wearing a snowmobile helmet and buried approximately 6 feet below the surface of the snow.  Rescuers estimated that he was buried at a similar depth.  The snowmobile was also completely buried. </p>
<p>Members from both SAR teams described the scene as being very busy with family members, friends, and other snowmobilers (approximately 20 snowmobiles).  Adding to the complexity of scene management was the presence of four helicopters, one of which was a private helicopter.  While there were no incidents related to the relative chaos at the scene, the number of people and machines presented a challenge to all rescuers on site during the search and recovery effort.</p>"

The party took the approved uptrack through the open resort toward Silver Basin. As they left the confines of the operating ski resort, they broke trail and continued up into the basin instead of trending left toward the backcountry terrain away from the resort. The group decided to take a break on a knoll below the headwall of Silver Basin. At this point, some members of the party reported feeling uneasy about ascending the headwall toward the ridgeline. A brief discussion occurred and they decided to continue. </p>
<p>As the team ascended the headwall via a long traverse, they continued to break trail and about 250 vertical feet below the ridgeline they saw cracking and “felt the snow change”. They turned back across the slope to the north, intending to find a place to transition for the ski down. At this point, all six members were close together when the slope avalanched. The entire party was caught, carried, and deposited in two groups of three. </p>
<p>The upper three members of the group came to rest approximately 200 vertical feet below the trigger point. Of this group, skiers 1 (not critical) and 3 (critical) were partially buried, while skier 2 was fully buried.</p>
<p>The other three members of the group were deposited approximately 350 vertical feet below the trigger point. Of this group, skiers 4 and 5 were fully buried, while skier 6 was partially buried (not critical). Skier 4 was swept through a tree island and over a small cliff during the descent.</p>"

They planned to start early the next morning and practice rope and snow travel skills on steep, snow-covered terrain. They left the trailhead about 4:30AM on the morning of June 6 and followed the summer trail into the alpine area below the east face of Torreys Peak. They formed a single roped group and began ascending an area locally known as Dead Dog Couloir. They moved up the steep snow-cover slope practicing traveling as a rope team and placing snow pickets.</p>
<p>By about 8:15AM they were about halfway up the couloir and stopped for a short break.

Debris and ice hit the two-person rope team as they began their climb of the west face of Reality Ridge at approximately 5:00 AM.</p>
<p>The surviving climber, 31-year-old male from Logan, Utah, was knocked unconscious by the impact.  When he regained consciousness, he located his partner and determined that the 32-year-old male from Rigby, Idaho had died in the accident.  The surviving climber then alerted park officials using an InReach satellite communication device at approximately 6:00 AM.  Despite significant injuries, the surviving climber managed to move to a location outside of the debris zone to await rescue.</p>
<p>Denali National Park’s high altitude helicopter pilot and two mountaineering rangers flew to the accident site just past 7:00 AM.  The rangers evacuated the injured climber to a safer location on the Ruth Glacier where they provided emergency medical treatment before returning to Talkeetna State Airport.  The patient was transferred to an air ambulance for further medical care. The helicopter pilot and two mountaineering rangers attempted to return to the accident site midday Thursday, however clouds had moved into the area.  Mountaineering rangers returned to the site Friday, May 14 and recovered the climber’s remains via short-haul.</p>

The weather made visibility difficult and the light was very flat, making it hard to see the edge of the ridge. One of them stepped off their sled not realizing how close they were to the overhanging cornice on the edge of the ridge. They took a few steps towards the edge and a large (~40 ft) section of cornice broke underneath them. They fell onto the slope below with the large cornice pieces and triggered a wind slab avalanche on that slope. This avalanche was about 100 ft wide. The large cornice pieces and the avalanche swept the person down the slope over cliffs and through rocks and chutes. The avalanche debris was about 15 ft deep in places and about 100 ft wide. The avalanche size was about D2.5, R3.</p>
<p>The person came to rest about 900 vertical feet below the cornice. They were found on the surface (not buried) with traumatic injuries incompatible with life. Another party who witnessed the event from below initiated CPR before rescue crews arrived but the victim did not survive.</p>

<p>Our thoughts, condolences, and sympathy are with all those affected by this tragedy. Our thanks also go out to those who helped with the recovery effort. This incident represents a sobering reminder of the risks that exist in the mountains. We visited this site on 3/21/21. Due to the steep technical nature of the terrain and the remaining large overhanging cornices we chose not to get close to the slope. Instead, we circumnavigated Frog Lake Cliffs and looked at the site from various angles from safe, accessible terrain.</p>"

Three of the four riders were familiar with the terrain and rode this location often.  At approximately 15:45, the party reached the end of the road below the opening on the north slope of Custer Peak (Photo 6). Two of the party members started up through the trees, covering the 200ft vert and entering the opening. Rider 1 and 2 did one ride up the lookers left side of the opening, sticking close to the trees and avoiding the maid open bowl. The majority of this side of the opening is sub avalanche terrain but connected to avalanche terrain above it. The top out of their climbing area was in the low 30s.They climbed to the top of the left side of the opening and came down and traversed back along the trees.  As they were approaching the entrance to the area, they saw that Rider 3 had decided to come up.  Rider 1, going downhill, rode by Rider 3, and starting to make a turn to come back up with Rider 3. Rider 2 had remained above on a small bench area. Rider 2 could see snow sliding below him where Rider 1 and 3 were, closer to the right side of the opening. He saw Rider 1 turn and start riding out of the avalanche. He saw Rider 3 turn but then get caught. He then realized that the slope above him had started to slide and swept into him. Rider 2 stayed on top of his snowmobile and pinned the throttle, riding downhill on top of the slide. He deployed his airbag but stayed upright on his snowmobile. His snowmobile was slowed down and eventually stopped when it ran over a large tree that had been snapped by the slide.  Rider 1 was making a turn to go back to ride up with Rider 3 when he saw snow sliding behind him towards where Rider 3 was. He stayed on his snowmobile and was able to ride up and out of the right flank of the avalanche, getting his snowmobile into the trees.  Rider 3 was caught, carried, and fully buried. Rider 2 kept eyes on him for as long as possible, but had snow packed in his helmet while he was being carried by the avalanche.  (Photo 3)</p>
<p>As soon as the slide stopped, Rider 2 dismounted from his sled and had voice contact with Rider 1.  Rider 2 started downhill towards where he’d seen Rider 3 disappear.  After a few seconds he took off his airbag (deployed) because it was too difficult to walk with it on.  He grabbed his rescue gear and his extra rescue gear from his sled and left his airbag bag with his sled, which also contained his radio.  Rider 1 also started heading down the hill on foot with all his rescue equipment towards where Rider 3 had disappeared in the trees, calling 911 as he was headed down. He delivered coordinates, location, and basics of what happened. They started a transceiver search and had Rider 3’s signal immediately. They followed the transceiver signal until the numbers weren’t getting smaller. They were unable to locate Rider 3 with a probe strike, but quickly realized it was because he was too deep according to the transceiver numbers. They started excavating the area, removing 4 to 5 feet of snow and were able to get lower readings and able to probe Rider 3. They continued digging until they were able to uncover his face and body.  They estimated that he was buried under 12 to 14ft of debris and it took them roughly an hour of digging to reach his airway.  Rider 3 was pinned around a tree with visual signs of trauma. His airbag had been deployed but was deflated. Rider 1 performed CPR on Rider 3 for approximately an hour before he was no longer capable.  Rider 2 continued to dig to be able to extract Rider 3 from around the tree. (Photo 7)</p>
<p>When they had entered the trees where Rider 3 was buried, they had yelled down to Rider 4 who had remained on the road below when Rider 3 had come up through the trees.  Rider 2’s radio was up on his sled and Rider 1 didn’t have a radio, so they were unable to contact Rider 4. It is unknown what time Rider 4 left, but he did not help with the rescue. </p>
<p>During the rescue, Rider 1 had called a friend (Rescuer 1) very familiar with the riding area, who drove from Spokane to Dobson Pass and snowmobiled in. When he reached the area (approximately 1.5 hours after the slide), they started self-evacuating. Rider 2 went back up to get his snowmobile and dug it out, while Rescuer 1 and Rider 1 prepared deceased Rider 3 for transport. They then left the area to travel back to Dobson Pass.  Rescuer 1 transported the deceased Rider 3, and Rider 2 transported Rider 1.  They made it back to Dobson Pass at approximately 8PM where they transferred Rider 3 to medical personal. Medical personal transported Rider 3 down the Pass, where his wife was able to meet the ambulance.  Rescuer 1 then returned to the site of the avalanche and recovered Rider 1’s sled and towed it back to Dobson Pass.  Rider 3’s sled remained on site after the accident, located approximately 60ft downhill from Rider 3’s burial spot (Photo 8).  The toe of the debris was approximately 100ft downhill from the sled.  </p>

<p>Avalanche forecasters from the Idaho Panhandle Avalanche Center (IPAC) visited the site on February 28th. On February 28th, the visibility was limited due to low lying cloud cover.  Winds were calm and there was no new precipitation. Overview photos were taken on February 27th by a witness who was riding across the drainage approximately 1.5miles away from the accident site (Photo 3). The rest of the photos were taken on February 28th during the site visit by IPAC. Visibility on the 28th and the knowledge that there was hang fire located on the right flank/crown limited the forecasters from visiting this side of the slide. The photos from the 27th were used to better delineate the avalanche.  </p>
<p>The avalanche was a hard slab avalanche in an open riding area that had a start zone area in the low to mid 30 degrees.  The open area is flanked by mature timber and funnels down to mature timber through a slight depression. Multiple 8” diameter trees were broken in the path of the avalanche and flagging occurred on larger timber that remained standing at the bottom of the slide path (photo 9 and photo 10).  The slide path ranged from 20 ft to 1350 ft at its longest length. Debris from the middle of the crown to the right flank ran the furthest of this extent.  Exposed bed surface ranged from 10ft to approximately 700ft. </p>"

<p>At approximately 0800 hrs, Matthew Brien (snowboarder), Brad (snowboarder), and Matt H. (skier) arrived at Taggart Lake Trailhead.  They discussed whether they should go to the Broken Thumb Couloir, expressing some concerns for safety and “getting over their heads or getting into trouble”.  The group had read the Bridger-Teton Avalanche Center forecast for the day and discussed the recent wind loaded slopes.  Brien had skied a south facing couloir on February 21 off Shadow Peak into Avalanche Canyon and had discussed the wind effect in that area.  The group ultimately decided to bring ropes and harnesses to “take a look at” the Broken Thumb area and left the trailhead around 0815 hrs.</p>
<p>During the ascent of 25 Short, the party of three caught up to Nick and Caitlin. They re-discussed both groups’ plans for the day and then continued up together for a little while eventually separating as they neared the top of 25 Short.  </p>
<p>Nick and Caitlin stopped a couple hundred feet from the top of 25 Short due to the high winds.  They decided to descend the north ridge of 25 Short to ski a more conservative and less wind effected line further to the east.  They did not bother to look at the entrance to Turkey Chute because of its exposure to the recent wind load.  </p>
<p>At about 1100 hrs, the group of three reached the top of 25 Short and began to transition to descend the Broken Thumb Couloir.  Matthew Brien led the descent with Brad and Matt H. following one at a time. They utilized FRS (Family Radio Service) radios to communicate positioning and movement.  After what they described as three pitches of riding/skiing, the group stopped together at 9030 feet approximately 300 feet above the entrance to the confined Broken Thumb Couloir. </p>
<p>Brien began riding the pitch into the top of the couloir when the slope avalanched 50 to 100 feet above his location. Brad yelled “Slide! Slide! Slide!” into his FRS radio channel 19-1.  Brad and Matt H. lost sight of Brien as he was carried into the couloir by the avalanche.</p>
<p>Nick and Caitlin were beginning to ski a couloir approximately .5 miles down canyon to the east. They decided to turn on their FRS radios to coordinate their descent.  Because Nick and Brien ski together regularly, they both use FRS channel 19-1.  When Nick and Caitlin turned on the radios, they heard an excited voice, which they thought was Matthew Brien, yell “Avalanche!” on the radio. </p>"

The group was visiting from out of state, and this was their first day of riding in the area this season. Several members of the group had ridden in the same area in previous years. The group carried avalanche rescue gear, and some were wearing airbags. The riders stated that some members of their group had checked the forecast that morning and believed the danger was rated MODERATE (Level 2 out of 5). The avalanche danger was actually rated CONSIDERABLE (Level 3 out of 5) on upper elevation slopes where they were riding.</p>
<p>The group left the parking lot around 9:00 AM and rode up the Smiley Creek drainage toward their destination. They spent some time riding in the open meadows along the way but were focused on riding towards the back of the drainage. After arriving at the base of the area where they intended to ride, some members of the group began climbing higher up onto the slopes above. They climbed to a high bench at 8,300’ and were highmarking a small slope above this bench (Figs. 1 and 2). </p>
<p>One rider continued beyond this slope, climbing upwards and across the slope to his left, riding below a line of mature trees. The rider’s track continued past this line of trees into more open, steeper terrain where he triggered a very large avalanche (Figs. 2-4). The other members of his group did not see him trigger the avalanche, but one of them saw the avalanche running and alerted the other members of the party via radio. </p>
<p>The victim deployed his airbag and was carried at least 400 vertical feet downslope. He was visually located on top of the debris (Fig. 8) by his riding partners. They were able to reach him within minutes. His partners determined that he died as a result of trauma incurred during the avalanche and did not attempt resuscitation. </p>"

Boarder 1, a 44-year-old male, was visiting from out-of-town and had been riding in the backcountry regularly but not locally.  Boarder 2, a 45-year-old male, lived in Bozeman and had not ridden in the backcountry in a few years. Neither had been to Beehive Basin before to ride. Both read the avalanche forecast that morning and carried rescue gear of a beacon, probe, and shovel. Rider 2 had taken an avalanche Level 1 class a couple years ago and also had a recent First Aid and CPR certification. Their intent was to stay in low-angle terrain and have a mellow day because they had been following the avalanche report and knew there was a weak, unstable layer of snow near the ground.</p>
<p>They followed the skin track and noticed at least one ski line descending the slope that they were headed to. The skin track they were following became buried in new snow and they had to break their own trail. As they ascended the slope they did not see any signs of instability (recent avalanches, collapsing, cracking) and they planned to dig a snowpit when they got higher. About ? of the way up the 35+ degree slope they felt it collapse, saw cracks spreading around them and got hit by the avalanche. Both members of the party were caught. Boarder 1 was slightly higher and to the north, trying to grab trees and fight off the slab as the avalanche went over him. Boarder 2 was carried approximately 300 feet downslope where he impacted a tree and was partially buried with his head downhill. Boarder 1 heard his partner yelling, knew that he was injured, and immediately called 911. Boarder 1 descended the slope and found his partner entangled in a tree with a life-threatening open fracture on his left thigh. He provided first aid and worked to keep his partner warm and calm while they waited for Gallatin County Sheriff Search and Rescue in Big Sky (GCSAR). GCSAR started skiing to the site in less than an hour after the 911 call. Shortly after their arrival Boarder 2 began losing consciousness. They moved him and provided first aid and soon began CPR. A GCSAR helicopter was already en route from Bozeman. It landed on the debris and two rescuers were attached underneath and short-hauled to pick up the patient. They were flown to Big Sky Fire Department where the patient was taken to Big Sky Medical Center and then transported by Life Flight to Bozeman Deaconess Hospital. Tragically, Boarder 2 succumbed to his injuries and passed away that evening.</p>"

Both groups were ascending when the avalanche happened. Group A was near the top, and Group B was below. This avalanche was likely human triggered, but it cannot be determined by whom. Six people were caught and fully buried. Two of them survived, and four did not.</p>
<p>Note: Several take-home points and lessons are included at the very bottom.</p>
<p>Their names are grouped into their respective groups below. Each party was traveling separately and had not seen or talked to each other that day.</p>
<p>Group A - Chris, Sarah, Louis, Thomas, Steve</p>
<p>Group B - Nate, Ethan, Steph</p>
<p>Group A started at the Butler Fork trailhead in Big Cottonwood Canyon (BCC) at approximately 0700. They used the Butler Fork trail to access a ridgeline between Soldier Peak and Wilson Peak with a plan to ski the Wilson Glades. While they knew that Wilson Glades was avalanche terrain, they considered it a safer option during HIGH avalanche danger. They thought any avalanches in that area would be “pockety” and did not think the entire slope would avalanche as it did.</p>
<p>While ascending Wilson Peak, Group A noticed a very large natural avalanche in the Wilson Chutes on the east-facing part of Wilson Peak. They posted a photo of this avalanche on Instagram and tagged the Utah Avalanche Center at 0833.</p>
<p>Group A reached the top of Wilson Peak (9,950 feet). At the top, they discussed how to ski Wilson Glades but never discussed if they should ski it or not. They discussed avoiding the steeper sections and going one-at-a-time with everyone participating in that discussion. No other party had been there that day, and they descended/skied the Wilson Glades one at a time. Once the group reached the bottom of the slope, they started breaking a trail back to the top to ski Wilson Glades again.</p>
<p>Group B approached the Wilson Glades from Millcreek Canyon starting at 0830. They began walking on skis from the end of the plowed road, approximately three miles to the Alexander Basin trailhead. They began breaking a trail uphill to the Wilson Glades drainage from that trailhead, just east of Alexander Basin. Group B saw several natural avalanches in Alexander Basin while ascending their route into the Wilson Glades. As Group B continued up Alexander Basin into the Wilson Glades, they all discussed the avalanche danger. They were all aware that the avalanche danger was rated HIGH for the day in that terrain.</p>
<p>Group B was aware that the Wilson Glades could avalanche, and their general plan for the day was to avoid avalanche terrain. Their specific travel plan was to ascend the Wilson Glades, stop at some point before the steeper section, and then discuss a plan for where to go and what to ski. Ethan and Steph were familiar with the area, while it was Nate’s first time skiing the Wilson Glades as he had just moved to Utah on January 1st. Both groups made observations of recent avalanche activity, but neither dug a snowpit to investigate the snowpack.</p>
<p>Group B reached the bottom of Wilson Glades and noted many tracks in the area and a recent skin/uphill track to the looker’s left (to the east). They followed the skin track uphill. When Nate and Ethan reached a point where they could see the steeper slopes above them, they waited in a sparse opening in the trees for Steph so they could discuss their plan for the day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Group A had skied the Wilson Glades three times totaling 14 tracks down the slope. After their second lap, Steve was tired and opted to wait somewhere above while the group made their third lap. After the third lap, their plan was to climb back up and descend into Big Cottonwood Canyon to the Butler Fork Trailhead, where they had started.</p>
<p>After Group A skied the slope for the third time, they transitioned back into uphill/walk mode and began climbing up their previously set skin track. The group traveled together until they reached the steepest part of their skin track, where they regrouped at a large tree to cross the last part of the slope one at a time as they had done two times before.</p>
<p>While the four people in Group A were grouped together on the skin track at the large tree, Chris was in front, and he reported hearing something that sounded like an earthquake. The avalanche broke approximately 30 feet above them, and Sarah, Thomas, and Louis were swept downhill in the avalanche. Chris lunged for a tree and hit it so hard that the “wind was knocked out of him.” He was able to hang onto it and felt immense pressure while the avalanche swept over him. He saw nothing but blackness for 2-3 seconds. Both skis were ripped off his feet, and he was left hanging in the tree above the bed surface after the avalanche passed. Note - It is very rare that people can hang onto trees as Chris did.</p>
<p>At this point, neither group was aware of the other aside from Group B seeing Group A’s ski tracks and skin track.</p>
<p>Just as most of Group A was caught in the avalanche, Ethan and Nate, in Group B, were waiting together for Steph to catch up when they looked up and saw a wall of snow coming at them (see the image above for their approximate location). Ethan and Nate had only been stopped for roughly 15-30 seconds before they saw the avalanche, and all three were caught and fully buried.</p>"

The two reached the top of their intended descent route below a ridge line and were preparing to transition to ski/board when the avalanche occurred. Both riders were carried down the slope. The victim was quickly pinned and buried against a tree within 20-30 feet of their transition location. Rider 2 was swept through the trees and partially buried a distance down the slope. He immediately grabbed his avalanche beacon to prepare to search, but it malfunctioned. He began to dig in the most likely burial location he thought, back up the slope in the tree well and miraculously exposed a ski pole, which led to the buried victim. Approximately 25-30 minutes had passed since the initial burial. Rider 2 performed CPR for over an hour, but was unable to revive his partner. </p>
<p>After discussion with Rider 2, he stated that they performed a beacon check in the parking lot before they began their tour. Both beacons were functioning and had good battery life. Further investigation found a corroded battery compartment of the beacon which likely led to the malfunction.</p>"

Seconds later a larger wave of snow hit him from behind. Rider 4 immediately lost his skis and poles. He was engulfed in snow and tumbled violently. “It felt like I was in a river and I was fully under the snow for approximately 15 to 25 seconds” Rider 4 explained, and was “moving very fast a significant way down the gully”.

<p>Skier 1 and his partner read the avalanche forecast for that day and were very familiar with the area, having skied there for many years. They took 2 previous runs in the backcountry using the 9990 chairlift at PCMR for access. Their first and second runs were just south of Cone Head in the Owen's Line area. Both runs are about 0.6 miles to the south of the 9990 chairlift. They did not see any avalanches, cracking, collapsing, or other signs of unstable snow. They both carried avalanche rescue gear (transceiver/probe/shovel), and they did not dig a snowpit at any point during the day.</p>
<p>For their last run in the backcountry, they rode the 9990 chairlift, exited the resort through a gate, and entered the backcountry to ascend Square Top, a peak about 0.5 miles to the north. At approximately 3 p.m., they descended a ridge known as ""Square Top Sneak."" Approximately 2/3 of the way down the ridge, they stopped to discuss where to go next, as marked in the photo below. Skier 1 wanted to descend a relatively short 37 degree slope below them, and his partner did not. His partner wanted to stay on the ridge for the final portion of his run. The pair decided that the partner would wait and watch Skier 1 while he descended before skiing an alternate route down the ridge and regrouping below. The avalanche occurred just as Skier 1 entered the slope before he had a chance to turn downhill. He was caught, carried, and almost fully buried in the avalanche.</p>"

The snowboarder was riding with a skier, and neither of them was carrying any avalanche rescue gear. The pair was riding in the Canyons Village area of the Park City Mountain Resort, where they took four chair lift rides, ultimately bringing them to the top of the 9990 chairlift around 9:40 a.m. They hiked a short distance to access the Dutch Draw area at the top of the chairlift via the backcountry exit gate. From this gate, they left the ski area boundary, entered into the backcountry, and followed a ridgeline to the top of Silver Peak.</p>
<p>At the top of the Silver Peak, the rider began his descent of a slope called Conehead. When the snowboarder was midway down the slope, the skier started her descent. After making two turns, the avalanche broke at her feet, and the snowboarder was still midway down the slope where he was caught, carried, buried, and died from the avalanche. The skier was not caught in the avalanche.</p>
<p>Other avalanches along the Park City Ridgeline in the last week have been triggered remotely from ridegtops while others have been triggered by people low on slopes. It cannot be determined how this avalanche was triggered. It is likely that this avalanche was triggered by at least one of the two people on the slope or possibly by both.</p>"

Rider 1 was the first rider to cross the slope with what he describes as “a very small high-mark.” He triggered the avalanche from the bottom of the slope. He did not realize that the slope had avalanched and was hit from behind by the moving debris after turning his sled downhill. The force of the avalanche knocked him from his sled and pushed him head-downhill into the snow. He recalls seeing dark before “swimming” to the top of the snow. He was partially buried but able to stand up and walk away from the debris pile. His sled was damaged in the avalanche, and left it planning to return and make repairs.</p>
<p>On December 21, another group snowmobiling in the area noticed the large avalanche, the damaged snowmobile, and nobody around. They immediately began a transceiver search of the avalanche debris.

At this time the slope failed.  As soon as the group saw the slide break several members yelled and waved at the rider.  He was near the looker’s right flank of the slide and was not initially caught in the slide.  It is believed that the victim saw the group members waving and pointing as he was riding down-hill.  Between seeing them pointing and the natural fall line he moved toward the avalanche and rode over a large rollover that caused him to be launched 50-70 feet downhill.  When the victim landed his snowmobile was nearly vertical, landing on the back section of track and tunnel.  At this point the group lost visual contact with the rider.  </p>
<p>When the avalanche came to a stop the nine remaining members of the group immediately went into rescue mode.  They all switched to search mode on their transceivers and looked for surface clues.  The debris area was small enough that it was quickly covered, there was no transmitting signal found.  The group did get several false readings that they believe were from group members switching back and forth from receive to transmit.  After it was determined that they were not getting any good signals, they transitioned into a probe search, and initially searched downhill of the victim’s snowmobile.  Rescuers believed they got a probe strike and dug down to the depth of the probe, unfortunately that was not the victim’s location.  At this point one member of the rescue group used a GPS messaging device to alert family members that they would not be back when they had planned, the SOS feature was not activated at this point.  The group then worked uphill from the rider’s sled, following what they believed was the natural flow of the avalanche.  He was found with a probe strike 30 to 50 feet uphill of his snowmobile below four feet of avalanche debris.  He had been fully buried for 2-2.5 hours when he was uncovered and was in a semi-prone position with his head downhill.  He had an avalanche transceiver, but it had not been turned on.  He also had an avalanche airbag that had not been deployed.  CPR was initiated, all possible lifesaving efforts were made.  </p>
<p>It is not known exactly when the group activated the SOS feature on their GPS messenger, based on information from Bonneville County Sheriff’s Office deputies, it is believed that they activated it approximately 90 minutes after the avalanche occurred.  The victims avalanche transceiver was turned on and checked after he was recovered, it functioned properly.  The cause of death was reported to be asphyxia.    A rescue helicopter requested by the Bonneville County Sheriff’s Department flew to the site the next morning and removed the body.</p>"

The first person descended to the left of the center of the avalanche path where she stopped mid-slope to video her partner. As the victim began his descent, the slab fractured just above him and propagated along the ridge. It carried him past his partner, who barely avoided being captured in the slide. As the avalanche proceeded out of view and stopped, the partner called for verbal response and then initiated a transceiver search, believing the victim to be wearing a transmitting transceiver. After covering the long slide path without detecting a signal, she called 911 at 3:15pm. Teton County Search and Rescue (TCSAR) mobilized and organized an initial response. Teams accessed the site by skinning from the Coal Creek Parking Lot. Although available, the TCSAR helicopter was not able to assist due to cloudy conditions. TCSAR teams were able to access the toe of the debris via skinning the southeast ridge of Taylor from the Coal Creek Parking Lot. They then proceeded uphill, performing a transceiver search through the entire path, including smaller debris piles (near trees, etc) almost to the crown.  It was determined the victim was not transmitting a transceiver signal. At 7:00 pm TCSAR teams were called off for their safety given the darkening conditions in complex terrain where additional avalanche hazard remained. Although dog teams had been mobilized, there was not enough time to get them on site safely that evening.</p>
<p>TCSAR resumed the search early on April 2nd. Although challenged by additional rescuer concerns given the COVID 19 pandemic, SAR was still able to execute a thorough inter-agency rescue. The TCSAR helicopter worked with Jackson Hole Ski Patrol (JHSP) to perform avalanche mitigation on terrain that could and did avalanche onto the existing debris. Two JHSP avalanche dog teams were dispatched and both Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT) and Bridger-Teton Avalanche Center (B-TAC) avalanche specialists were also present. Once avalanche mitigation concluded, 2 dog teams, 3 probe teams, 2 RECCO searchers and rescue leadership personnel arrived on site via skinning up the southeast ridge of Taylor Mountain. Upon arrival at the toe of the avalanche debris, which was relatively narrow, the first dog on scene quickly made an indication at 11:00 am, approximately 30 yards from the start of the search. </p>
<p>The victim was buried head downhill, face up, approximately 2 feet under the surface. He was removed from the scene via helicopter and pronounced dead by medical staff. He had an avalanche transceiver in his pants pocket that was found in the off position. Although the avalanche carried the victim through sparse trees and possibly over rocks, the coroner noted no evidence of massive trauma, indicating that asphyxiation was the cause of death.  He was a passionate backcountry rider with avalanche experience. He had been an intern with the Utah Avalanche Center prior to spending several years in the Jackson Hole Area.</p>"

Rider 2 followed the same general path, but stayed higher on the slope. Rider 1 was traversing when he triggered a small avalanche. The slide was 4 to 6 inches deep and broke in wind-drifted snow. It was a small avalanche initially. As it ran down the slope the avalanche stepped down to a layer about 18 inches deep. Cracks shot widely across the slope and the avalanche gained more volume. As the debris continued to run down and through the chute it stepped down to a deeper layer, a foot or more above the ground. The slide eventually eroded into the very weak basal facets (depth hoar layer), removing the entire snowpack. This created a very large avalanche that rumbled down onto the Loop Road. </p>

They ascended Apollo Creek, crossed into Brodie Gulch, climbed to a high saddle near the head of the gulch, and then descended into the Baker Lake area (Fig. 1). They did not observe any avalanches or obvious signs of instability and were avoiding large avalanche paths they knew had claimed lives in past years. About 0.5 miles NE of Baker Lake, Rider 1 (age 59) turned around and stopped while sidehilling to take a photo (Fig. 2, Position A). Rider 2 (age 49) was lower in the drainage, caught up to him, and was riding on the slope below him. </p>
<p>At approximately 2:00 PM, one or both of the riders triggered an avalanche from well below the crown (Fig. 2). Rider 1 was briefly caught, turned his machine downhill, and rode off to the side of the slide while the avalanche was occurring (Fig. 2, Position B). He reported that the slide was extremely quiet, that it “barely even whispered when it swooshed by me.” After escaping the slide, Rider 1 became stuck near some dead trees to the side of the debris (Fig. 2, Position C). He dug out his machine, rode to the edge of the debris, and did not see his partner. He switched his transceiver to search, got an initial signal of 14 meters, and followed the signal to Rider 2 who was completely buried.  </p>
<p>He located Rider 2 with a probe and began digging. He first uncovered Rider 2’s foot and continued digging to clear snow from around his head. Rider 2 was buried in a prone position approximately 3 feet deep, head downhill and face down. Rider 1 removed Rider 2’s helmet and determined he did not have snow in his mouth and was not breathing. Rider 1 estimated 40 minutes had passed since the avalanche released.</p>
<p>Rider 1 left the scene and returned to the trailhead approximately 10 miles away to report an avalanche death and get assistance. Bystanders at the trailhead notified emergency services via an inReach satellite communication device at 3:30 PM. Professional rescuers and medical personnel flew to the scene by helicopter (Fig. 2), arriving at 4:43 PM. Local search and rescue personnel arrived shortly thereafter via snowmobile.

This was an area they had spent a significant amount of time riding in and had been there the day before. The group made it up to an area near the Western Union Mine, riding in meadows along the way.  </p>
<p>They regrouped below a steeper hill climb in a meadow. Riders A and B took off from the meadow and headed up into steeper terrain. Rider A got his snowmobile stuck in the location in Figure 1 around 1PM. Rider B was watching Rider A from the side of the slope, when Rider A yelled, ""avalanche"". At this point Rider B started his snowmobile and took off down the hill to find Riders C and D.  </p>
<p>Rider B tells Riders C and D that there was an avalanche. All three riders head up the hill a short distance to the debris pile, but don’t see any sign of Rider A or his snowmobile. Rider B begins a transceiver search and picks up a signal. The group makes a probe strike, they believe to be Rider A and begin digging. They dig down 4’ and make it to the ground, but don’t find Rider A. Rider C performs another transceiver search and finds a new low point. Two riders begin digging at the new low point and dig down to find Rider A. After approximately 10-20 minutes Rider A is extricated, with his helmet on, he was buried about 3 ft deep.  </p>
<p>Rider A is then pulled out of the snow, but he is unresponsive. His helmet is removed and his airway checked (no snow is found in his mouth). The group performs CPR for over an hour, with no ability to resuscitate Rider A. With limited daylight, Rider A is taken out to the trailhead on a snowmobile. Emergency personnel were notified and the Baker City Police Chief and local Search and Rescue arrive at the trailhead around 6 PM. Coroner rules the cause of death asphyxiation.</p>"

Rebecca and Warren were left partially buried and were able to look around, connect verbally, and begin to extricate themselves. Rebecca also remembers seeing Scott’s arm and pole above her (on the slope) and Bill’s helmet below. Bill remembers punching his fist up to the surface as the slide stopped and waving in hopes that someone would see him. Ken remembers being able to see light and could move his right hand enough to clear snow from his face. We don't know what Carl, Scott and Molly experienced during this time. Based on a 911 link from Carl’s phone, it is likely that he was partially buried and was able to dial or voice activate the call, but there is no record of Carl talking to dispatch. Based on Molly’s final location in the debris, it is likely that she skied the skiers right treeline and was struck by the first avalanche as she traversed left across the bottom of '16 to 1'.  </p>
<p>Rebecca was able to free herself and crawl to Bill. Warren worked for a minute or two to dig out his skis and was close to being free of the debris. At this point, all four skiers remember a loud rumbling and shaking sensation immediately prior to being overrun by the second avalanche. </p>
<p>The second slide was larger than the first. A witness on the traverse described it this way: “The visibility was poor, foggy and snowing -- I was watching a narrow runnel of snow (kind-of like a sluff) moving downslope just past the treeline when the entire mountain started to move … I’ve never seen anything like it … it was loud, 4-6 feet deep … snow moving as far as I could see across the slope.” As the second avalanche overran the seven skiers, Warren was further buried up to his armpits, Rebecca was carried another 25-30 feet downslope and again left partially buried, and Scott, Ken, Bill, Carl, and Molly were further buried under a significant amount of debris. Figure 9 depicts their final placement.   </p>
<p>The second avalanche clearly involved snow above the first slide, but it is not clear if it was triggered from the traverse, from somewhere farther up the peak, or if the remaining slab failed naturally on its own. Skiers coming from the top of the run via the hiking route describe skiing over a large crown and onto the bed surface after the two slides occurred (Figure 10). </p>"

What we do know is that he was riding in the Canyons Village area of Park City Mountain Resort with his wife and son prior to the avalanche. He left them and rode the 9990 chairlift. At the top of the chairlift, he most likely accessed the Dutch Draw area via the backcountry exit gate.

They ascended the normal skin track that winds up the runout of an avalanche path. They were feeling better than expected when they reached treeline at about 10,800 feet. They discussed going higher on Diamond Peaks, a change of their initial plans. They felt that the snow cover was thin and “that there was hardly any snowpack up there, just enough to ski.” They decided to climb to the southern summit of Diamond Peaks, assess snow conditions, and ski down a run commonly called the South Diamond Face.</p>
<p>They ascended the standard skin track up low-angle terrain between the Diamond Peaks. They headed south along the ridge toward the South Diamond Face. They dug a snow pit near the top of the run. They found a six to eight inch thick layer of “granular crystals” which they identified as a weak layer, under another six to eight inches of hard-packed snow. Discussing the snowpack, they felt the lack of snow depth would keep any potential avalanches small. They decided to continue.</p>
<p>They quickly dug another snow pit at the top of the proposed descent route and found a very similar snowpack. They had another discussion and decided that although there was some risk they were going to descend the face. They planned their descent and identified a safer location to regroup.</p>
<p>Skier 1 descended to the skier’s right side of the face. He stopped below a rocky area with shallow snow cover. He called Skier 2 over to his location. They decided that Skier 2 would ski the next section first and they would regroup past the runout zone.</p>
<p>Skier 2 skied to skier’s left into the gully. She was about 150 feet below Skier 1 when she triggered the avalanche. Skier 2 managed to stay upright on her skis. Skier 1 noted that the avalanche did not look very deep, maybe only up to the top of her boots. Skier 1 kept an eye on his partner as long as he could, but visibility was poor and she disappeared out of sight.</p>"

This ridge separates Tuckerman Ravine from a stream drainage to the north known as Raymond Cataract. While on Lion Head, they noted a skier descending into Raymond Cataract, an ephemeral, but recently popular ski descent only possible during winters with a deep snowpack.</p>
<p>The hikers remarked on the solid and skillful turns the skier was making and watched him descend out of view. At the same time, two skiers skinning up the Tuckerman Ravine Trail watched a solo skier make a couple of turns in upper Raymond Cataract and then returned their focus to skinning. Unknown to anyone, within a few turns of both sightings, Skier 1 would ski over a convex 39 degree bulge and trigger a fatal avalanche.</p>
<p>At approximately 1330, Lead Snow Ranger Frank Carus stopped to talk to a friend on the Tuckerman Ravine trail close to Hermit Lake. They discussed a new avalanche crown line that the friend had seen earlier. Due to the reported crisp, sharp edges of the crown and the possibility for human triggered avalanches that day, Carus proceeded to gear up with skis and binoculars at Hermit Lake and head back down to a viewpoint to search for clues of human involvement. The urgency of the situation increased when one set of faint ski tracks were observed on the firm snow above the crown. The time was 1353.</p>"

Both groups intended to climb and ride a couloir on Black Mountain, just east of the Arapahoe Basin Ski Area. The two groups bumped into one another in the parking lot and it turned out that they all knew each other. They discussed their plans for the day and decided to remain separate. One group of three would climb and ride a couloir locally known as “The Dog Leg” and the other group would climb and ride a couloir locally known as “S#@t for Brains”. </p>
<p>They left the parking lot around 7:00 am and skinned through the ski area to reach Black Mountain. When they arrived at the bottom of the couloir they changed their plan and decided to stay together as a group of six. The full group consisted of  2 snowboarders and 4 skiers (1 female and 5 male). They decided they would bootpack up the couloir, gain the ridge, and then ride back down the way they came. They spaced out and began bootpacking up the couloir. </p>
<p>They had reached an area that they described as “about three quarters of the way up the couloir just below a steep bulge”. Just before 9:00 AM they triggered an avalanche that broke about 10 feet in front of the lead climber. The avalanche broke about 18 inches deep and propagated the entire width of the couloir. </p>
<p>Climber 1, the highest uphill, was hit by the avalanche and tumbled over Climber 2 who saw the slide coming and was moving out of the way. Climber 2 was not caught, but sustained a laceration most likely from the crampon of Climber 1. Climber 1 ended up about 600 vertical feet below, just uphill from the mouth of the couloir. He was on the snow surface and sustained minor lacerations. The avalanche swept Climber 3 off her feet.  She “was able to open her eyes, and saw periods of light and dark as she was swept underneath the snow.” She ended up on the snow surface about 50 vertical feet below Climber 1. She also sustained minor lacerations as well as some torn clothing and broken equipment. Climber 4 was able to get out of the way and did not sustain any injuries. Climber 5 was swept off his feet, but was able to stop after 40 or 50 feet. Climber 6, the last in the group, was knocked the farthest downhill and ended up on the surface approximately 700 vertical feet below where the avalanche first hit him. He sustained deep lacerations and needed to seek further medical attention. </p>
<p>The group called Arapahoe Basin Ski Patrol to report the avalanche. They informed the patrol dispatcher that they could get out under their own power. The group was met by patrollers as they entered the ski area and they were taken to the base area for evaluation and medical treatment. They were eventually released to seek further medical care if necessary.</p>
<p>The group described themselves as experienced backcountry riders. They were all carrying an avalanche transceiver, shovel, and probe. Only one person from the group had ridden in this couloir before.</p>
<p>This was a soft slab avalanche. It was most likely triggered from the bottom of the slab by the first person in the group. It was small relative to the path, and if the group was not in steep confined terrain the avalanche would have been relatively harmless. It most likely released on the interface between the freshly drifted snow and the old snow surface beneath (SS-AF-R1-D1.5-I).</p>
<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>We are happy that nobody was seriously injured in this accident. We write these accident reports to help backcountry users learn and practice safer travel techniques not to criticize those involved in an accident. There are some important takeaways from this event. </p>
<p>First, if you are traveling in an operating ski area it is important to stay out of closed areas. You should always exit a operating ski area through a marked backcountry gate. You do not want to inadvertently travel into an area where the ski patrol is doing avalanche control or set tracks that lead other people into trouble.</p>
<p>Second, it is always a dangerous proposition to expose more than one person at a time to avalanche terrain. If this avalanche was larger it could have resulted in multiple burials. If multiple people are buried or injured the complexity of the rescue and evacuation increases dramatically. </p>
<p>Finally, as this group found out, it does not take a very big avalanche to knock you off your feet when you are in a steep, confined avalanche path. Even a small avalanche like this one resulted in a rough, dangerous, ride and most of the group sustained injuries. </p>
<p>We would like to thank the Arapahoe Basin Ski Patrol for their help with this investigation.</p>"

Two of the three had been skiing this zone and specific terrain for over a decade. It was terrain they knew well. The plan for the day was not specific to any one line, they were simply seeking sheltered powder at/below treeline and had some ideas on where to find it. Snowboarder 1 had been riding in the area during the last storm, 3 days prior, and noted that the wind was blowing hard out of the south at the lake, with a slight rain crust on top of the new snow.</p>
<p>On the day of the slide, Snowboarder 2 checked the nearby Mt. Ripinsky weather station on the HAC website. He noted the temperature trends vocally to Skier 1 and Snowboarder 1, but made no mention of whether he had looked at the last posted avalanche forecast. Neither of the two other riders had checked it. (The last posted forecast was valid Monday 3/11, and expired that same day). Posted danger was Considerable and problems were Storm Snow and Persistent Slab. Among other things, it stated:</p>
<p>Problem #1: Storm Snow</p>
<p>Location: all aspects and elevations, but especially W-NW-N-NE aspects.</p>
<p>Heavy snowfall rates yesterday combined with moderate-strong SE winds will have created quite a bit of wind loading on lee aspects. Fresh storm slabs will be 30-60+cm thick and resting on a thick bed of weak facetted snow. Bonding to the old snow will be poor, and there will be lots of settlement. Natural and human triggered avalanches are likely in any wind loaded or cross-loaded areas. Some slides could be large and step down to old persistent slabs 60-90cm deep, causing wide propagation. Avoid all avalanche terrain. Watch out in steep clearings in the trees where new snow piles up deep and consequences are high. Stay well away from terrain traps. This new danger will likely persist for a while, due to the thick nature of the persistent facets underneath the new snow.</p>
<p>The group skinned up the valley a little, past the lake and chutes, to get a look at the valley and look for good riding for the day. They noticed some natural avalanches on north aspects up the valley that had run within the storm snow on steep, open, planar slopes well above treeline. The slides had likely run a few days before. Given this, they decided to avoid similar slopes, choosing lower-elevation terrain in the trees. They thought these areas would be protected from the winds and thus safer.</p>
<p>They made a plan to go up a skin track they were familiar with, through the trees looker's-right of the Lake Chutes. From the top of the trees they would ski down towards Chute 2 (the middle chute), seeking to avoid wind-affected areas. There they could either ski the chute or duck into the trees to continue down, depending on conditions. Skier 1 said, ""I don't think familiarity played a part. We approached just like any other day, with skepticism. We're always flexible on our plans.""</p>
<p>On the way up, they stomped on a small but steep test slope in the trees to help judge stability in the chutes. There was no result. They continued up to the drop-in point, assessing as they went, with quick hand pits. They did not see anything that gave cause for alarm.</p>
<p>The three skied from the drop-in point to the entrance of Chute 2. From there, Skier 1 and Snowboarder 1 watched Snowboarder 2 ski the top of the chute and duck into a post-up spot in/near some trees mid-slope that they had always thought was a safe place to wait (they had skied this line together before, and had a protocol on where to wait in the trees). Skier 1 began to descend along the margin of the upper trees, and immediately triggered a slide within the new snow that was small at first. ""It was triggered from a thin spot in the trees, where there were small trees under the snow."" The two riders yelled ""Avalanche!"" down towards Snowboarder 2. At first the small slide seemed benign, and it seemed that Snowboarder 2 was safe. Then the avalanche stepped down, and began to propagate very wide and deep, taking the entire chute with it. Snowboarder 2 was quickly caught and swept down. The debris moved very fast.</p>
<p>Skier 1 and Snowboarder 1 carefully descended the bed surface, which was described as very slick and hard, like glare-ice. It took approximately 4 minutes. They switched their beacons to receive close to the last-seen point, and were able to get a signal quickly as they descended the runout. Skier 1 quickly followed a curving flux line in, did a pinpoint search, and began probing. He hit Snowboarder 2 on the second probe strike. The two began shoveling, and got to Snowboarder 2's backpack first. They hastily dug around to his face, which was about 3ft deep total. He was unconscious. They checked for a pulse and positioned him for CPR. CPR was administered, but was ineffective due to trauma. Total burial time is estimated at about 8 minutes. He was wearing a helmet and did not have an airbag.</p>
<p>The two were able to call 911 right from the site using a cell phone (the call came in at 12:44pm). Haines Search and Rescue immediately mobilized a helicopter from a private company, and it arrived in about an hour. Snowboarder 2's body was transported via helicopter. Skier 1 and Snowboarder 1 descended on their own via the trail they came up.</p>"

They spent Friday night in the cabin and around 1:00 pm on Saturday March 9th headed out for an afternoon ski tour. Due to stormy weather and known avalanche danger, the group chose to only travel in low angle terrain. They decided to take their plan A (skiing bigger lines) off the table.  They ascended a Northwest facing aspect off the shoulder of Madson Mountain above Crescent Lake, east of the Crescent Saddle Cabin. The group of three climbed to around 2,100’ (close to treeline) and skied a lap on a slope between 25 and 35 degrees. Observing no red flags on the first lap, they ascended again for a second lap and transitioned to ski mode together at a small clump of trees just slightly higher than their first transition point. On the second lap, Skier 1 skied down 50’ or so to another small clump of trees. Skier 2 then skied to spot skier’s right of Skier 1, stopping on the slope also near trees. All three were spaced out across the slope when the Snowboarder saw a crack propagate next to him as the whole slope released to his right. The Snowboarder described the open slope cracking higher into the peppered trees above his partners. The Snowboarder yelled 'slide' and watched Skier 2 (who was stationary at time of avalanche) get washed down the slope. Skier 1 was immediately pushed into a tree and held on. His skis were pulled off and subsequently broken as 3 waves of debris washed over his head. Skier 1 was convinced he was in the avalanche, moving downslope but as the debris passed, Skier 1 was still holding onto the same tree, unburied. The Snowboarder rode to Skier 1 to ensure he was okay and they both started yelling for Skier 2 with no response. The Snowboarder immediately descended the bed surface and started a beacon search but did not yet have a signal. He spotted a ski pole ~500' below and moved directly toward it.  From the ski pole, the Snowboarder quickly found a signal from Skier 2’s beacon and was able to get a reading of 2.1 meters at the lowest point.  At this point the Snowboarder began digging and within 10 minutes of the avalanche Skier 2’s face/airway was clear though he was unresponsive.  Skier 1 ran/rolled down the slope due to skis being destroyed and assisted digging Skier 2 out completely. Skier 2 was totally extracted in about 20 minutes. They then performed CPR for around 30 minutes with no life signs. The Snowboarder attempted to make a cell phone call but had no cell service at the accident site and decided to skin back toward the trailhead to call for help. It took 2.5 hours in the blizzard to find a cellular signal closer to the trailhead and call 911. Skier 1 moved Skier 2’s body down to the edge of the lake and marked it with a probe before walking out on foot to the trailhead. U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement officers, Moose Pass EMS and Alaska State Troopers rode snowmachines in to the site to retrieve Skier 2’s body that night.  </p>
<p>All three of the group members had avalanche rescue gear (beacon, shovel and probe), two had formal avalanche training (one with Level 1 and one with Level 2), and all were regular ski partners with multiple days in the backcountry together. Skier 2 and the Snowboarder had practiced avalanche rescue skills together a month before. They had discussed bringing avalanche airbags but decided that they did not have enough space to carry all the supplies and equipment in airbag packs for a multi-day cabin trip. The group had read the Friday Avalanche Forecast for Turnagain Pass (CNFAIC.org) and discussed the avalanche hazard and incoming weather with the plan to avoid steep terrain due to the storm/ hazard. They did not observe any signs of instability while skinning up to the cabin or on their first ski lap. While breaking trail on their first lap they described localized cracking on their skin track with small 3-4 inch slabs breaking at the kick turns.  They did note the winds increased significantly between lap 1 and lap 2.</p>"

The clients said that the avalanche “was breaking trees like popsicle sticks”, and the group thought the avalanche was going to impact them all. The powder cloud hit the entire group with enough force to push some people around. Client 12, who was moving slowly across the bench, was hit by the first wave of avalanche debris. He said he was carried in the flow and came to rest fully buried. A few seconds later a second wave of debris hit the pile he was buried in, and carried him further downhill. He could hear trees breaking as he tumbled in the debris. He finally came to rest below the regroup point on the snow surface. He was uninjured.

The 27-year male had been riding on the lower portion of an avalanche prone slope when he decided to ride up into the upper portion of the slope. The other three members of the group were watching from a safe location.</p>
<p>The rider was making a turn in the avalanche starting zone when they heard a very loud crack and saw the avalanche release. The rider headed downhill and deployed an airbag. His companions watched the rider get knocked off his sled and then lost sight of him and his sled as the slide gained momentum.</p>
<p>All four of the men were wearing avalanche transceivers and had avalanche rescue gear and training. The three companions quickly rode to the toe of the slide and started a search for their missing friend. One ski of the missing rider’s snowmobile was protruding from the snow at a location that was about 40 feet above the toe of the avalanche. One searcher honed in on the location of the missing rider who was completely buried a distance of about 15 feet from and to the side of his sled.</p>
<p>Another one of the searchers had assembled a probe and struck the buried rider on his third stab. The rider was quickly excavated and CPR was initiated.</p>
<p>The group reported that it took six minutes to locate and extricate the rider from the avalanche debris. The Teton County Search &amp; Rescue received a call at 2:51 pm informing them that this accident had occurred and that CPR was in progress. Teton County Search &amp; Rescue volunteers responded via a helicopter. The man was pronounced dead at the scene just before 5 pm. The Teton County coroner determined suffocation was the cause of death.</p>
<p>The rider was found to be face up. His head was 2.5 feet below the surface of the avalanche debris. His body was at an angle to the slope. His feet were buried to a depth of four feet. He was wearing a helmet and goggles which were not filled with snow. The airbag was inflated, still attached to the buried rider and also completely buried by avalanche debris.</p>

He descended without incident a lower angle ridge north of the slope that later avalanched.  At the bottom of this run, he met two other skiers (Skier A and Skier B) who had skied a similar line. They had not planned to meet. The three skiers discussed their run and felt confident about good snow stability. They transitioned to uphill travel mode and skinned up a safe route with the intention of skiing another run in the same area. Skier A and Skier B had left a car at Truman Gulch Trailhead, approximately three miles to the west of the accident site, with the intention to ski out at the end of the day and not return to the ski area.  </p>
<p>During their ascent Skier 1 moved faster and remained on his own, separate from Skiers A and B. At approximately 1400 hours Skier 1 removed his skins and dropped into a steeper, more exposed northwest facing slope at the top of the St. Lawrence slide path. Skiers A and B were still ascending on the skin track and had stopped to eat. At the top of the slope Skier 1 made one ski cut without results before dropping into the main path. After making two or three turns he triggered the avalanche which propagated above him and carried him roughly 1000 vertical feet through small dense trees. He came to rest near the toe of the debris.</p>
<p>Skier A witnessed Skier 1 drop in and trigger the slide. Skier A and B watched Skier 1 disappear in the fast moving debris.</p>
<p>Skiers A and B immediately transitioned to downhill ski mode in order to start a search. While descending, Skier A triggered a small slide while traversing a steep slope leading to the debris. Skier A was not caught in this slide. Once on the debris, Skiers A and B began a transceiver search, picked up a signal within 10 minutes and were led to a hand sticking out of the snow. They quickly uncovered Skier 1 and began resuscitation efforts. There was obvious trauma to the head and face of Skier 1 which made CPR difficult. At 1407 hours Skier B called Bridger Bowl Ski Patrol to inform them of the accident. After 10-15 minutes of CPR Skiers A and B felt uncomfortable in the slide path and moved skier 1 to a safer location. They continued CPR for another half hour to 45 minutes. Bridger Bowl Ski Patrol was in contact with medical control and received approval for the rescuers to stop CPR due to obvious trauma and significant time since the burial. Efforts to revive Skier 1 were unsuccessful. </p>
<p>All three skiers were familiar with the terrain and each carried an avalanche beacon, shovel and probe.  Skier 1 was wearing a helmet, but the forces in the fall destroyed it.</p>"

Their plan for the day was a backcountry tour to gather field information, focusing on potential instability on southerly aspects. They were both experienced backcountry travelers, both familiar with the terrain, but had not toured together before.</p>
<p>They met at the Washington Gulch trailhead around 11:00 AM and snowmobiled to the Elkton townsite where they switched to skis. They ascended the wind-scoured southeast ridge of Mount Baldy.  A separate solo skier (Skier 3) was about 90 minutes ahead of the pair, and had already made one descent of the south face of Mount Baldy.</p>
<p>The pair descended a short distance from the summit. Skier 2 watched from low-angle terrain near the ridge. Skier 1 descended the south face first, spooning the solo skier’s tracks. Skier 2 lost sight of Skier 1 as he skied over a convex roll in the slope. Expecting to see his partner lower on the slope, instead Skier 2 saw the flowing avalanche and then Skier 1’s deployed avalanche airbag. The airbag was visible when the avalanche stopped. </p>
<p>When the avalanche broke, Skier 1 attempted to traverse down and left, towards the southeast ridge. The avalanche quickly pulled him down and he deployed his airbag. When the avalanche stopped, Skier 1 was partially buried in a standing position, with debris covering his shoulders. Skier 1’s skis were buried at the old snow surface under the avalanche debris. Skier 1 was wearing the leg loop of his avalanche airbag and his pack did not shift dramatically.</p>
<p>Skier 2 descended lower-angled terrain around the roll and entered the avalanche path. He began a transceiver search as he headed towards the visible airbag. He stopped the search once the transceiver indicated Skier 1 was near the airbag location. It took 10 to 15 minutes of digging to free Skier 1, and longer to excavate his skis. Skier 1 was uninjured, and the pair returned to the trailhead. Because the avalanche was visible from the town of Crested Butte, they notified authorities that no rescue response was necessary.</p>"

They rode up Pole Canyon and proceeded into the some of the most challenging terrain in the Snake River Range. After lunch and riding in the Dry Canyon area the party split up into two groups. Group 1 was comprised of 4 riders. Group 2 was comprised of 3 riders. Later in the afternoon the first group was in an area known as Neeley Cove. Neeley Cove is located in the headwaters of the Siddoway Fork drainage of Big Elk Creek. It is high alpine terrain in two east facing cirques and is situated among some of the highest peaks in the range.</p>
<p>The group of four riders decided to exit the north cirque of Neeley Cove by riding up a steep south facing slope. All four had turbo based systems on their sleds. The most experienced (local terrain knowledge) rider went first. He was on his second attempt to climb the slope and achieve a ridgeline when he turned and began to ride back down the slope. The slope failed and he was caught in a large avalanche.  The avalanche barreled down the slope and hit his three companions. They lost site of the first rider as they braced for impact.</p>
<p>When the slide stopped all three riders at the bottom of the slide were partially buried. Two of those were buried to their waist. The third was completely buried except for one hand. The avalanche debris was soft and that third person was able to raise his head out from beneath the avalanche debris. All three were uninjured and self-extricated. The rider who set off the slide was missing. He was wearing an avalanche transceiver and a search was initiated. As they closed in on the beacon signal the searchers heard the nose of a running snowmobile beneath the surface of the avalanche debris. One of the searchers uncovered the rear bumper of that sled and then quickly uncovered the boot of their missing companion. He was buried vertically with his head down and had deployed an airbag. His head was about six feet below the surface of the avalanche debris. His helmet was packed with snow. CPR was administered; however the rider did not survive. The official cause of death was asphyxiation.</p>
<p>This avalanche accident was reported to have occurred sometime between 4 and 4:30 PM. At 6:12 PM a member of the group involved in the accident made it to a location where he was able to call the Bonneville County Sheriff’s Department on a cell phone.  Based on the circumstances, plans were set in motion for an organized rescue the next morning. The survivors rode back to the trailhead.</p>
<p>This accident occurred in technically challenging terrain during dangerous avalanche conditions. A group of rescuers, comprised only of the very best riders, made it to the site on sleds the next day. They used a rope and pulley system to pull the body of the 35-year old male uphill to a flat area where he could be removed from the site by a helicopter.</p>

A guide from Big Sky Backcountry Guides, the company that owns and operates the yurt, led the skiers into the yurt for an orientation and briefed them on local terrain, snowpack and weather history. After briefing and orientation the guide left for the weekend.</p>
<p>On the morning of Friday, January 25, the four skiers left the yurt and ascended a nearby skin track up a forested, less than 35 degree, south-southeast facing slope. During their ascent they dug quick hand pits which revealed a poor snowpack structure of weak, sugary snow below a slab of recent snow. Due to these findings, and a “whumph” and cracking of the snowpack they had experienced the day before, they decided to seek lower angle terrain and play it safe. They gained a ridge that runs east off the summit of Long Mountain, and skied a few hundred feet down the opposite, northeast facing slope. </p>
<p>The skiers stopped on a low-angle bench less than halfway down the track of a large avalanche chute on the east aspect of Long Mountain. They decided to traverse back southeast and gain the ridge where their skin track came up from the yurt. They contoured a little ways, then put their skins on to ascend towards the ridge. They set switchbacks up a treed, 36-40 degree steep, east-southeast facing slope between the slope they had ascended earlier and the slope they had just skied. At approximately 1315 hours skier 1 (age 45) and skier 2 (35) were relatively high on the slope and close to each other, skier 3 (42) was one switchback behind, and skier 4 (35) was another switchback or two behind skier 3. Skiers 1 and 2 heard a loud, roaring “whumph” and looked up to see the slope above them avalanche. They were close to the top, grabbed trees and were able to hold on as the avalanche pushed by them.</p>
<p>The avalanche carried skiers 3 and 4 through thick trees. Skiers 1 and 2 began a beacon search, and quickly heard groaning and yelling from the other two skiers. They located skier 4, who was groaning and partially buried against a tree. Skier 1 stayed with skier 4 and performed first aid/CPR after he stopped breathing. Skier 2 continued to skier 3 who was partially buried 200’ (estimated) lower than skier 4. Skier 3 had dug himself out. </p>
<p>Skier 4 was revived a couple times during CPR, but died on scene. Skier 3 was badly injured with broken legs and other trauma. They were able to call 911 to inform authorities of the avalanche, the critically injured status of skier 3 and death of skier 4. They were in one of few spots in the area that has a cell signal.</p>
<p>Each skier had an avalanche beacon, shovel and probe. Skiers 1, 2 and 3 were experienced backcountry skiers with 30-40 days per season, and each had taken a level one avalanche class. Skier 4 had less experience and some basic avalanche training.</p>"

At approximately 4:00 p.m. one member of the party (rider 1) climbed to a steep, high pass with an easterly aspect at 11,974’, between Mount Mellenthin and a sub peak of Laurel Mountain. Three other members of the party followed with riders 2, 3 veering off to the looker's left, while rider 4 took a straight line up a narrow gully. Two snowbikers (riders 5, 6) were lower to the left, under a group of trees beneath the SE face of Laurel Mountain. Riders 7, 8 were riding beneath a small knoll out of sight of the rest of the group.</p>
<p>Rider 1 reported feeling a collapse as he looked down from the pass, and he saw the slab fail and propagate outward onto the entire NE face of adjacent Laurel Mountain. Rider 4, who was headed up the gully, took the force of the avalanche head on from approximately 600' below where the slide had initiated. Riders 2, 3 reported last seeing him in the avalanche at approximately 11,350’. Riders 2, 3 rode out to safety on the looker’s left side.</p>
<p>When the avalanche stopped, the party regrouped near the toe of the debris, did a head count, and realized that rider 4 was missing. Members of the party attempted a search. Between them they had 3 beacons, two shovels, and one probe. They believed rider 4 was wearing a beacon, and reported hearing a “ping.” They uncovered a snowmobile near the toe of the debris, and located a helmet, but not the victim. Rider 5 left the scene to call 911, and San Juan County dispatched a Classic Air Medical helicopter, but as darkness was falling, further search and rescue efforts were suspended until the following morning.</p>
<p>Coordination efforts between San Juan and Grand counties, and the USFS Utah Avalanche Center began around 6:00 p.m. with the San Juan County Sheriff’s Office in command.  Plans for search and rescue efforts the following day included an aerial reconnaissance to determine scene safety, and contingency plans for avalanche mitigation, and professional avalanche rescue dogs and handlers from Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, with support from the Utah Department of Public Safety.</p>
<p>At 7:00 a.m. on January 26, a reconnaissance flight determined that avalanche mitigation work would be required to render the scene safe for search operations. While waiting for the arrival of the bombardier team, a DPS helicopter flew over the debris with a RECCO unit and a Long Range Receiver (LRR). A RECCO unit is a specialized search device for people with a RECCO reflecting chip built into their clothing. The LRR detects signals from avalanche beacons. They reported a signal from the LRR near the last point scene and dropped a flag. Avalanche mitigation work produced one very large avalanche but the debris did not over run the original avalanche debris. This work was completed at 2:35 p.m. and dog teams were inserted near the last point scene at 3:10 p.m. A beacon search was performed with one of four searchers receiving an erratic signal. A dog alert near the signal prompted a probe search of the area. Meanwhile, the other dog and handler continued down the debris. At 4:20 p.m. the second dog alerted near the toe of the debris, and at 4:35 a positive probe strike was made. The body was recovered about 150 feet uphill of the victim’s snowmobile. He was buried 2-3 feet deep. He was not wearing a beacon, but had one turned off in his pack. </p>"

One skier initially triggered a small sluff in the faceted snow, which knocked both skiers over. The initial sluff then triggered a soft slab that broke approximately 100 feet above the two skiers. The slab continued to fracture 150 feet further up the hill, along  the leeward, north side of the small ridge. The top portion of the crown was in a small concave bowl near the steepest part of the ridge. The slab avalanche at its widest point was roughly 150 feet wide, averaging two feet deep and ran approximately 200 vertical feet. </p>
<p>The debris from the slab avalanche washed both skiers into trees. Skier 1 was partly buried to his chest, and Skier 2 was partly buried-critical, with only the top of one arm visible.

Leidy at 3 PM when the slope failed.  The person, who was caught, triggered the avalanche from the bottom of a steep slope and was fully buried.  His partner was looking the other way and when he turned to look at the slope the movement of the avalanche was ending.  He did not see his partner or his sled.  The witness then used a radio to call the other members of his group, who were in the vicinity, to come help.  </p>
<p>The buried man was not wearing an avalanche beacon.  Five members of the party began to search the avalanche debris for visual clues.  As more members of the group arrived to help they spotted the handle bars of the buried rider’s sled in the avalanche debris.  The group had two avalanche probes and plenty of shovels.  They began to probe uphill and downhill of the sled.  A probe struck the helmet of the buried rider about ten feet uphill of the sled.  The buried man was then excavated by the group from beneath six feet of avalanche debris.  He was found head downhill, face down and was still wearing his helmet and goggles.  There was no mask of frozen snow around the man’s face and no snow was found to be in his mouth or nose.  CPR was performed but he did not survive.    </p>
<p>At 3:16 the Teton County Sheriff’s Office received a call from a member of the party and was informed that a person had been caught and buried in an avalanche.  Teton County Search &amp; Rescue volunteers were mobilized and a helicopter was dispatched to the accident site.   The helicopter arrived at 4:08 and departed the site with the patient at 4:43 PM.  The cause of dead was determined to be asphyxia by the Teton County Coroner.      </p>

Leidy at a location that is approximately 13 miles southwest of Togwotee Mountain Lodge.  This group of riders accessed this area from the lodge.  A vicinity map (Figure 1) shows the location of the lodge, the accident site and groomed snowmobile trails that lead from the lodge towards the site.  An accident site map (Figure 2) depicts the terrain features at the accident location, an outline of the area of the slide, and the burial location.</p>"

<p>By early afternoon the complete group of 10 had met up, were playing, and riding in the same general area, although not necessarily all together.  Around 3:30pm two riders from the group of 6 had departed en route back to the trailhead with the understanding that everyone was beginning to move that way. <em>Note: At this point, this accident summary assumes the group of 6 riders is now a group of 4 that were in the immediate vicinity of the avalanche. </em> </p>
<p>At approximately 3:40pm Rider 1 and Rider 2 crested over a sub-ridge and descended into a gully (Image 1) en route back to the trailhead.  Simultaneously Rider 3 was side-hilling/ascending the same gully and crested above Rider 1 and 2. </p>
<p>With three people on the slope at the same time and in fairly close proximity, it is unclear from where exactly on the slope the avalanche was triggered.</p>
<p>Rider 4 was out of the way in a safe zone, and witnessed the avalanche initiate and propagate about 200’ above where Rider 3 was on the slope.  Rider 4 described seeing Rider 1 and 2 disappearing and reappearing in the moving debris.  None of the 3 Riders on slope saw or heard the avalanche until it hit them.  Rider 3 (highest on the slope) was immediately thrown from his sled and was able to successfully deploy his airbag backpack.  He came to rest mostly on the surface, with just his legs buried and separated from his machine by 50’ or more.  Rider 1 was about 10’ behind Rider 2 when the avalanche hit them both from behind.  Rider 2 describes getting spun 360 degrees on his sled as the debris hit him.  He quickly realized he was in an avalanche, got his bearings and pinned the throttle in an effort to power out of and ahead of the moving debris.  He described the next several seconds as diving under the snow then resurfacing before diving again.  Rider 2 never separated from his snowmachine and came to rest near the toe of the debris still clutching his machine and buried up to his armpits/ neck with one hand free.  Rider 2 and 3 were uninjured.  All three machines were fully or mostly buried once the avalanche came to rest.</p>"

Two riders were on the slope when it failed. Once was completely buried. The other was not and the third rider was not in the slide path. The missing rider's sled was partially buried. One rider went for help. The other rider had a shovel and no probe and remained on site. The buried rider and the rider who remained on site did not have avalanche beacons. Search and rescue was contacted at 4:10 PM. Search and rescue volunteers arrived at a nearby helicopter landing zone at about 5:10 PM. By about 5:45 PM those volunteers had traveled from the landing zone and found the buried rider by probing. He was buried uphill of his sled, under 4 feet of avalanche debris in a prone position with his head downhill. He did not survive.</p>

On Saturday, April 14th he was the first person to exit into the backcountry from the south boundary of Bridger Bowl. He was wearing an avalanche transceiver and had a shovel and probe in his pack. He was by himself and hiked to the north summit of Saddle Peak (9100’). Saddle Peak is exposed and complex alpine terrain. The skier descended a couple hundred feet down a lower-angled ridge which rolled over to 37 degrees  where he triggered the avalanche, which broke on a wind-loaded slope 1-3’ deep and 100’ wide, running 1500’ vertical down a path locals call “North Central.” The avalanche failed on a thin rain crust under the new windblown snow. The skier was carried to the toe of avalanche debris down a steep and narrow avalanche path. He came to a rest in an upright position with his arm extended above his head and gloved hand at the snow surface. </p>
<p>A person riding Schlashman’s Chairlift (one mile north of Saddle Peak) saw the skier trigger and get caught by the slide. The skier went out of view and the person on the chair could not determine if the skier escaped the avalanche. He informed ski patrol at the top of the lift who then called GCSAR. As members of GCSAR the patrollers began mobilizing for a rescue and talked to three other people who skied off the summit of Saddle Peak, but none had seen the missing skier. Included in these three were two snowboarders who saw the crown but did not know it was triggered by the skier ahead of them. </p>
<p>At 11:41 a.m. three members of the Bridger Bowl Ski Patrol descend one at a time off the summit of Saddle Peak in search of the missing skier. They skied down the avalanche path and at 11:50 a.m. a rescuer gets an initial signal at “50 m” on his avalanche transceiver. One minute later, at “2.4 m”, the rescuer sees a gloved hand at the snow surface among the small debris chunks. Two minutes later the victim’s face was uncovered 1.5’ from the surface and at 12:05 p.m. he was fully uncovered. The victim was buried for 75-minutes and showed no sign of life. </p>
<p>Separately, three members of GCSAR and a search dog flew towards the scene in a helicopter while additional resources drove to Bridger Bowl. While the helicopter was in the air the victim was located and rescuers announce that no further manpower was needed. </p>

They discussed their options and decided to further evaluate the Northwest facing slope below. Rider D descended approximately 20 ft into the upper part of the slope, found a location to dig a snow pit, utilized his probe to check depths, and began excavating. Skier C skied down to Rider D and they spoke about what they were finding. The snowpack where they dug their snow profile was approximately 47”  (120cm) deep. They discussed finding a crust/facet sandwich down 24” (60cm) and loose facets near the ground. They performed a Compression Test with no results. Meanwhile, A and B stayed on the ridge.

It was too late in the day to dispatch rescue teams, however Ketchikan Volunteer Rescue Squad sent a team the following morning to check conditions and attempt to find the burial location. Due to 50+ mph winds and heavy snowfall, the search was suspended. Poor weather continued Tuesday and Wednesday, preventing the search from continuing. On Thursday March 1st, a joint team comprised of Ketchikan Volunteer Rescue Squad, Juneau Mountain Rescue, and SEADOGS was able to locate the buried subject with a Long Range Receiver via helicopter.

They responded to the incident under the authority of Teton County Search and Rescue which is part of Teton County Sheriff’s Department.  Two patrollers were able to arrive at the accident site by 11:27 with guidance from a Jackson Hole Mountain Guide who was nearby. By communicating with medical staff at the St John’s medical clinic at the base of the ski area regarding the extent of the trauma, AM was pronounced dead on scene.  Although the witness and tracks indicated it was unlikely that others were caught, it was not a certainty as the slight chance existed for travelers below the cliffs to have been hit from above.  For that reason, Jackson Hole Ski Patrol members initiated a transceiver search, and called for additional personnel including a trained avalanche rescue dog. At 11:43 the beacon search was finished with no additional signals found and at 12:25 the dog search was complete and the search was terminated.  The victim was transported to the bottom of Rock Springs and then to the medical clinic at the base of the resort.  </p>
<p>Although the survivor had a pack, transceiver, shovel and probe the deceased did not carry avalanche safety gear.  The victim was wearing a helmet earlier that day but had left it for unknown reasons for that run.  Given the severity of the trauma, the lack of a helmet is not thought to have affected the outcome of the accident.</p>"

The other three were intermediate riders, all six had a beacon and shovel and three had probe poles. The victim had an airbag vest and avalanche awareness training, the only one in the group to have these.</p>
<p>They rode to an area familiar to one of the group on the lower slopes west of Sage Peak (10,664’) in the southern Madison Range. On the day of the accident the slopes of this popular area near the accident site were mostly untracked. A 3.5 mile long ridge runs southeast off the summit of Sage Peak and snowmobilers regularly climb the many southwest facing gullies. There were no avalanches on the entire ridge. The only sign of instability was when one member of the party triggered a small, 10-foot wide avalanche on an east facing slope 900’ away from the eventual accident site. After triggering this slide, the group decided the stability was poor and they would not highmark or play on the larger slopes. Soon after, one snow biker and one snowmobiler rode up a gully below a 300-foot hill. The biker was stopped at the bottom of the hill. The snowmobiler rode past and turned around, stopping about 50’ away on a small bench. Moments later the avalanche hit and buried the snowmobiler 25’ downhill at the bottom of a gully.

<p>On the morning of the accident, Rider 1 read the Statewide Avalanche Avalanche summary from the previous day. He was aware that the storm the night before had changed conditions, so the pair planned to ""get a workout and maybe a few turns without getting into serious terrain."" They also hoped Rider 2 could get some practice transitioning on his splitboard.</p>
<p>They found 6 to 8 inches of fresh snow at the trailhead, more than they expected. They left the trailhead about 09:00 and reported breaking trail with their vehicle once they got above the Pine Creek Cookhouse above Ashcroft. On their approach, they saw intermittent blowing snow near ridgelines, as well as some scoured patches and some wind-loaded gullies. They observed no cornices or natural avalanches. </p>
<p>Because of conditions, the pair decided to ride lower in the drainage than they originally planned. They skinned up lower-angled slopes at the base of Greg Mace Peak, sticking to slopes with scattered trees and avoiding open slopes. They found 2 to 16 inches of fresh snow, the variability due to extensive wind redistribution. They observed frequent cracks that broke up to 16 inches deep on a layer of facets between the slab and the ground. </p>
<p>Their approach switchbacked up through terrain that gradually steepened. The pair stopped near treeline, in an area where the slope angle was approximately 35°. The terrain above was steeper and more open. They were below two wind-loaded snowfields but felt the snow they were on was disconnected from terrain above. They transitioned to downhill travel in an island of trees at about 11,150 feet. From there, they could access a half-pipe-like gully that drained the snowfields above.</p>
<p>After discussing safe stopping points, they entered the gully one at a time. Rider 1 descended and pulled up on rider's left in a rocky area with shallow snow. He tried to get completely out of the gully. When Rider 2 descended, Rider 1 felt a distinct collapse. Rider 2 passed him and went to their agreed-on safe spot on rider's right of the gully.</p>
<p>Rider 1 had his back to the slope above (regular riding stance). He felt what seemed like a blast of wind and then got clobbered by fast-moving debris from behind. He found himself in ""a big, fast avalanche."" He felt helpless. He reached for the trigger of his airbag but realized he wasn't wearing it. The debris pushed Rider 1's head downhill. He couldn't see, couldn't get above the snow, and thought he was going to hit a tree and die. He estimated he was moving at highway speeds.</p>
<p>Rider 1 stopped after about 400 vertical feet. He came to rest head downhill with his mouth and nostrils just above the snow. One outstretched arm was out of the snow, along with one leg. His snowboard was still attached. He could barely breathe, and snow fell into his mouth every time he moved. He said he was ""iced in"" by the debris. He was uninjured, though he felt beat up. </p>
<p>The debris dusted Rider 2, but he was able to stay high enough on the gully wall to avoid getting caught in the debris. Rider 2 watched the avalanche go past, yelled several times, shuffled to get a better view, then started descending. He saw Rider 1's hand moving and thought it was a tree, then realized it was Rider 1. He rode down to Rider 1, reaching him about a minute after the slide hit. Rider 2 uncovered Rider 1 and the pair self evacuated. </p>
<p>Rider 1 had over two decades of backcountry experience, extensive avalanche training (Level 1 and Level 2 courses), and some guide training. Rider 2 was also an experienced backcountry rider but did not have avalanche training, though he was scheduled to take a Level 1 course the next month at Rider 1's encouragement. They are regular riding partners. Rider 1 had traveled in the area several times in the weeks prior to the accident.</p>
<p> Rider 1 reported the slide was 80-100 feet wide, with a crown depth of 2.5-5 feet deep and average depth of about 3 feet. It released at about 11,320 feet; Rider 1 was hit at about 11,000 feet and stopped at about 10,600 feet. The gully channelized and confined the moving debris, which left a narrow debris field that had some rectangular blocks.</p>
<p>In the 36 hours prior to the accident, the Upper Taylor SNOTEL (10,640 feet; 3.5 miles ESE) recorded 1.6 inches of snow water quivalent and temperatures dropping from the mid-30s to the single digits on the morning of the accident. Temperatures rose to the upper 20s by the time of the accident. Winds during the storm were strong to very strong, with gusts over 90 mph at Snowmass Ski Area (11,385 feet; 12 miles north-northeast).</p>"

I was still on my feet, so I skied with it, heading down but slightly across it for about 20 meters before I reached stable snow.

<p>On Saturday, October 7, a pair of skiers, Skier 1 (male, 27) and Skier 2 (female, 23), hiked from the Upper Taylor Fork trailhead to Imp Peak (11,202’) in the southern Madison Range of southwest Montana. They were experienced skiers and had both taken a Level 2 avalanche class. They intended to ski the north couloir on Imp Peak, a known ski route described by author Thomas Turiano in Select Peaks of Greater Yellowstone: A Mountaineering Guide and History:</p>
<p>“The mountain’s most distinctive features are a pair of steep and wide couloirs that drop from the broad saddle between the summits over 1,000 feet down both the north and south sides of the mountain… These weaknesses provide the easiest routes to the summit when filled with snow in winter or spring. They each are about 40 degrees steep near the top and ease to about 30 degrees at the bottom.”</p>
<p>The pair left the trailhead (7,250’) at 0600 on Saturday for a 6 mile approach to the peak. Hiking on a dirt trail, carrying their equipment, they likely transitioned to ski gear at snowline around 9,200’. Near 10,000’ at the bottom of the couloir, they were ascending on skis with skins when they triggered the avalanche. Both were caught, Skier 1 was buried to his mid-chest and back of neck, and Skier 2 was fully buried. Skier 1 had an avalanche beacon, shovel and probe. Skier 2 had a shovel, probe, and an avalanche beacon that was turned off in her backpack. We have no knowledge about Skier 1’s beacon prior to the search.  </p>
<p>Skier 1 dug himself out of the debris. He turned his beacon to “search” and scanned the debris for Skier 2, but did not get a signal. They had not done a previous beacon check.

They made their way through the trees to a terrain feature commonly known as ‘V Max hill’ and descended into the main drainage below.</p>
<p>They rode roughly ½ mile past V Max hill heading East up the drainage. At this point both snowmachiners were riding on the South side of the valley on some lower benches underneath steeper slopes connected to a ridgeline ~600' above them. Right before the avalanche, Rider 1 was on the uppermost bench waiting for Rider 2. As Rider 2 rode up and past Rider 1, Rider 1 began to descend the upper bench slowly. Around 30 seconds later, Rider 2 rode down past Rider 1 at a very high rate of speed then veered to the right. At this moment, Rider 1 was caught from behind by the avalanche and carried down the slope with the debris roughly 200-250’. The avalanche was never seen by Rider 1 prior to being caught.</p>
<p>Rider 1 was buried near the top of the debris and was able to push his right arm above the surface; Rider 1 commented that he had known to try to use his arm to help create an airspace and he felt this is likely why the right arm ended up close enough to the surface to stick out.</p>
<p>Rider 1’s face was also close enough to the surface that he was able to spit out and wipe away the snow from his face and maintain his airway. Rider 2 was caught at an unknown point below Rider 1 and buried around 8’ deep just downhill and around 100’ East of Rider 1. Rider 2 was buried head downhill, on his side in a horizontal position. Rider 2’s snowmachine was fully buried roughly 100’ below Rider 2’s burial location. Rider 1’s snowmachine was around 100’ below Rider 1’s burial location.</p>
<p>Rider 1 had seen the CNFAIC avalanche forecast for Turnagain Pass before the weekend and knew there was risk of triggering an avalanche in this zone. Both riders were in an area they felt was reasonable and were not looking to get into avalanche terrain. Both Rider 1 and 2 had avalanche transceivers on their bodies. Rider 2 had a shovel strapped to his snowmachine tunnel and was not wearing a backpack. Rider 1 was wearing a backpack with a shovel and probe inside the pack. Rider 2’s level of avalanche training is unknown. Neither Rider had an avalanche airbag. Rider 1 did not have formal avalanche training, but had done personal research/education using internet resources. Rider 2 had 2 years of mountain riding experience and Rider 1 had 8 years of experience riding snowmachines in the mountains.</p>"

Stanton,,,avalanche,backcountry_skiing,fatal,1,0,"<p>A member of the party involved provided valuable information regarding the incident and all of the events of the day. We appreciate this individual taking the time to provide this information under such tragic circumstances. </p>
<p>A party of three experienced back country skiers parked at the Lake McDonald Lodge parking lot in Glacier National Park at approximately 10:00 a.m. (Figure 8). They were all equipped with avalanche transceivers, avalanche shovels, and probes and they read the avalanche advisory that morning. They skied up the Going-to-the-Sun-Road (closed to vehicle traffic in winter) to the North Lake McDonald Road (1.5 miles). They put climbing skins on their skis in this vicinity and then continued skiing on this road to the Trout Lake trailhead (1.5 miles). They then followed the Trout Lake hiking trail for approximately 2.5 miles to a location just below where the trail crests Howe Ridge. From this location the skiers left the trail and started climbing up the west ridge of Mt. Stanton. Eventually this group reached the tree line where they encountered a short, steep rocky knob. At the top of this knob one member of the party mentioned that he was feeling ill and was going to eat some food and then descend their skin trail back to the hiking trail and retrace their path to the parking lot. It was decided that he would wait at the vehicle for the other two members of the group. </p>
<p>Skier 1 and 2 continued to follow the west ridge of Mt. Stanton toward the summit. The party noted a weak snow pack on their ascent to the ridge, as well as, areas of weak snow and scoured surfaces along the ridge. Eventually they reached the summit, and, after a brief break, decided to descend the same ridge that they climbed. Skier 1 went first and carefully and slowly skied the ridge from the summit limiting his exposure. Both members of the group would either make 1 or 2 turns on the adjacent slope but then cut skiers right back to the ridge or just stay on the ridge. In this fashion they made their way down to the upper portion of the sub-ridge that separates the two large southwest facing avalanche chutes on Mt Stanton. </p>
<p>At approximately 2:00 p.m. Skier 1 traversed across the relatively broad ridge and into the top skiers left of the western most of the two avalanche paths. He performed two ski pole tests in this area (to determine general snowpack structure), then made one left hand turn followed by an immediate right turn. Between these turns Skier 1 down weighted his skis once or twice in an attempt to test the snow stability. Shortly after completing his right hand turn he triggered the avalanche, possibly while down weighting. The avalanche broke uphill of Skier 1 and immediately knocked him off his feet. </p>
<p>Skier 2 remained on the ridge during the time that Skier 1 traversed the sub-ridge and entered the avalanche path. When the avalanche occurred, Skier 2 was able to observe Skier 1 being swept downhill on top of the avalanche debris. Eventually Skier 1 was swept over a convex terrain feature (also known as a rollover on the slope) which effectively blocked the vision of the path for Skier 2. The avalanche had stepped down to the ground almost immediately, leaving a bed surface consisting of mostly rock. </p>
<p>After losing sight of his partner, Skier 2 cut skier’s right of the slide hoping to descend faster via a snow surface than the bed surface. He quickly realized that there was a possibility of triggering another avalanche and determined it was best to descend the bed surface. He then switched his transceiver to receive and initiated a transceiver search while descending the bed surface. His descent was slow and difficult due to the rock bed surface and convex terrain features and small cliff bands. Eventually, Skier 2 exited the slide skiers right where the slope angled lessened and the risk of triggering a secondary slide decreased. He descended this snow until he reached the debris. Upon reaching the debris he was able to ski the debris to the toe. During this transceiver search, he was unable to obtain a signal. At this point, he removed his skis, stuck them in the snow, and proceeded to walk back up the debris. Upon reaching the top elevation of the debris he had still not yet picked up a signal. He called out for Skier 1 and was able to hear a faint reply. Skier 2 continued to call out, and eventually successfully located Skier 1 in this fashion. </p>
<p>Skier 1 was above the debris field and not buried. He was on the snow surface against a tree with his head downhill and in a semi-conscious state. After evaluating the injured skier, Skier 2 determined that significant trauma had occurred, called 911, and requested a helicopter evacuation. While waiting for the helicopter, Skier 2 attempted to warm and comfort skier 1. Two Bear Air Rescue responded and extricated Skier 1 from the scene. </p>

<p>Two skiers hiked/traversed into CLOSED uncontrolled terrain at Mt. Rose. This terrain had NOT BEEN OPENED, HAD NOT BEEN SKIED, and HAD NOT BEEN CONTROLLED this winter. It is more analogous to a backcountry snowpack. They decided to drop into a steep wind-loaded slope. The first skier triggered a large avalanche that swept him 600-1000 ft downslope and buried him n debris that averaged 5 ft deep and reached up to 10 ft. deep in some areas. The second skier immediately called 911 and the search for his partner continued for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>The avalanche that this skier triggered likely started as a wind slab failure and stepped down onto the persistent weak layer of facets near the base of the snowpack. The slab was a mix of 1F (1-finger) and 4F (4-finger) hardness snow sitting on top of F (fist) hard facets. This avalanche started on a 40-45 degree slope and pulled out adjacent slopes that reached up to 50 degrees in steepness. The slopes that released were mostly N aspects with some NE aspects on the skier's left of the paths. The initial avalanche was likely 350-550 ft in width and connected multiple start zones. It was at least a D3 on the destructive size scale. The crown measured between 3 and 5 ft. in depth.</p>
<p>Later in the day after continued wind loading and snow accumulation, explosive control work triggered additional similar avalanches that started as wind slabs and stepped down to the old persistent weak layer. Ski cuts on small wind loaded test slopes caused shooting cracks and wind slab failures up to 16 inches deep. </p>
<p>UPDATE 12/11/16</p>
<p>Searchers located the buried skier around mid-day 12/11. Avalanche dog teams from Mt. Rose, Sugarbowl, Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows, and Placer County narrowed the search area down to a large pile of debris where two of the avalanche paths came together. Washoe County Search and Rescue Team Members then probed this area and located the buried skier. He was buried under 220-260 cm of avalanche debris. This debris was from the slide he triggered as well as subsequent avalanches released during control work to create a safe area for searchers to operate in. </p>"

While standing near the center of the chute approximately 20 feet from the cornice edge and 20 feet from exposed rocks on the ridge, they identified an entrance on the skier’s right side that involved a relatively small, three to five foot drop off the cornice into the chute. They decided to ski the chute from the right side and began moving that direction, parallel to the ridge and cornice. A 50 foot wide piece of the cornice cracked and broke approximately 20 feet from the edge. Skier 1 (male, age 28) was near the cornice break line but was not caught. Skier 2 (male, age 29) was about five feet closer to the cornice edge. He fell into the crack that had opened as the cornice chunk rotated downhill, falling an estimated 25 feet and landing on his back. According to Skier 1, the cornice entrained snow as it broke up and moved downhill but did not trigger a slab avalanche. Skier 2 was carried downhill approximately 1150 vertical feet. He was partially buried with his head three feet deep and his feet and one hand sticking out of the snow. Skier 1 quickly skied down to Skier 2, excavated him, and cleared his airway within 3-4 minutes of the burial. Skier 1 determined Skier 2 to be not breathing and pulseless. Following CPR efforts, Skier 2 regained consciousness. The skiers moved downhill to a safer location but were unable to continue through flatter, forested terrain. Skier 1 built a small snow cave and fire and they awaited rescue. The injured skier’s condition gradually deteriorated. After two to three hours, he stopped breathing and could not be revived with CPR.</p>

<p>On January 24, 2016 two skiers from Bellingham, Washington were returning to their vehicle after a morning of backcountry skiing in the vicinity of Mt. Herman, west of the Heather Meadows parking lot/trailhead and located in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. This backcountry access point is at the end of Washington Highway 542 where it is plowed for the winter season.</p>
<p>The avalanche accident occurred on a NNE aspect of the NE flank of the false summit of Mt. Herman. For the return route the pair chose to traverse to Bagley Lakes, with the route crossing below a known avalanche path. The terrain in that area consists of a steep fluted face characterized by numerous cliffs and steep faces above a series of undulating gullies and ridges with semi- forested terrain below. The alternative return route of dropping down to Bagley Creek and back up to the Heather Meadows parking lot likely meant dealing with an open and difficult creek crossing.</p>
<p>They entered the slide path at 4650' and began traversing at about this elevation (See photos). Either during or after their traverse, Victim #1 sustained an injury that left him unable to ski and required to assistance of Victim #2 to move. Victim #1 may have fallen and hit a tree or been hit by initial snow blocks as a precursor to the 1st and 2nd avalanches. Snow surface conditions during the traverse were observed as difficult due to new snow hiding an icy avalanche bed surface and debris.</p>
<p>At about 12:40 hrs they contacted Whatcom County 911 via cell phone to request assistance. Whatcom Country 911 in turn contacted both Bellingham Mountain Rescue (BMR) and the Mt Baker Ski Patrol (MBSP).</p>
<p>At 12:49 hrs Justin Mitchell of BMR (who was already at the nearby Mount Baker Ski Area) contacted Naval Air Station Whidbey Island (NASWI) to alert them to the need for assistance with a rescue. Members of BMR and MBSP responded to the northwest corner of the Heather Meadows parking lot and were able to make visual and voice contact (via megaphone) with both victims shortly after.</p>
<p>Victim #1 was observed sliding feet first down a gully with the assistance of Victim #2. The latter indicated #1 had sustained injuries to his head and leg(s). Both were on foot at this point and not wearing skis.</p>
<p>At about 13:05 hrs, Sam Llobet of MBSP observed two large blocks of snow fall past both victims. Immediately afterwards a small but fast moving avalanche fell from the cliffs above and swept both victims about 200 feet farther down the gully.</p>
<p>Neither victim was buried by the first avalanche and they continued descending the gully. Though they still had visual contact, attempts by BMR and MBSP personnel to reestablish verbal contact were unsuccessful. Rescuers began assembling a team to approach the victims and determine level of risk the terrain above posed to rescuers</p>
<p>At 13:25 hrs, a second much larger avalanche released from the cliffs above the gully and hit both victims. They were swept another 600 to 800 feet down the gully to where it joined the main gully of Bagley Creek. Victim #1 was observed moving in the debris and was able to self-extract while # 2 had been swept down and out of sight of rescue personnel. Victim #1 did not respond to the rescue personnel above and was exhibiting signs of severe head injury.</p>
<p>After the second avalanche it was determined any ground based rescue would expose rescuers to unacceptable risk.</p>
<p>The helicopter from NASWI arrived on scene at 14:21 hrs. A Navy medic was lowered to the avalanche debris and assessed that Victim #2 had died of his injuries. Victim #1 was assessed as critical and lifted to the helicopter with medic and was taken to St. Joseph's Hospital in Bellingham.</p>
<p>Victim #2 was recovered the following day (January 25th at around 13:30 hrs) by a helicopter and rescue team provided by the King County Sheriff's Department.</p>
<p>After the initial injury and call for assistance we know of two observed avalanches:</p>
<p>The first avalanche [@ 13:05] was observed by rescue personnel. It struck and carried the victims a few hundred feet down the gully. No one observed this avalanche initiate so the real origin is unknown. Sam Llobet from MBSP stated he saw a few large snow blocks strike the slope near the victims immediately before the first [13:05] avalanche.</p>
<p>Between this statement and the fact weather and observer data from that afternoon points away from loose wet snow avalanches on shady aspects, we suspect the snow blocks and the first avalanche initiated from the lower portion or flank of the slab that caused the second, larger avalanche [@ 13:25]. Based on observations we feel it would be accurate to call this first avalanche size D1 or D1.5. All other statistics for this avalanche are unaccounted for but a potential classification would be (WS-N-R1-D1/1.5-G).</p>
<p>The second avalanche (WS-N-R3-D3-G) was observed @ 13:25. It released from a steep rock slab directly above the gully where the victims were located. As can be seen in photos 1, 3 and 5, only the upper portion of the rock slab has bare rock exposed. Below the exposed rock is a steeper portion of rock slab that is snow covered.</p>
<p>This lower portion of this rock slab is similar in appearance to other areas of the slide path which look to have released during the rain event of January 21st and 22nd. The bed surfaces (rock slabs) of these avalanches were most likely covered with snow on the afternoon of the 22nd as freezing levels lowered and/or on January 23rd with snowfall from a following system, also with lower freezing levels</p>
<p>Our conclusion is the second avalanche was the upper remnant of a glide avalanche that released from lower on the rock slab during the January 21st-22nd rain event. This slab at 4850', severely weakened by the rain and unsupported from below, was slowly slipping downward and coincidentally released while the victims were exposed in the gully beneath it. The debris from this avalanche reached the creek at the base of the path, traveling approximately 1000’.</p>"

<p>A party of three snowmobilers parked and unloaded their snow machines at the Olney parking lot at approximately 9:00 a.m. They were all equipped with avalanche transceivers, avalanche shovels and probes, and avalanche airbags. They checked their transceivers and began traveling up the road on their snowmobiles toward Upper Whitefish Lake. They turned off of that road onto the Swede Creek road (ungroomed and unplowed). They worked their way through technical riding terrain to Haines Pass (Figure 12 and 13). They followed the bottom of the drainage near Swede Creek and did not travel on the south-southeast facing open terrain that drops into Swede Creek.</p>
<p>At approximately 1:30 pm, the party decided to turn around as one member had plans that evening. The group of three found a small slope to descend to get back to their trail from their entrance in the morning. Snowmobiler 1 (32 year old male) walked to the edge of the slope to assess. He then remounted his snowmobile and started his descent 200-300 feet to the bottom of the slope. He saw Snowmobiler 2 (33 year old male) walk to the edge of the slope to assess it as well. Using hand signals, Snowmobiler 1 gestured to Snowmobiler 2 to go further to the right. He watched Snowmobiler 2 begin his descent, and moved his machine 3 to 5 feet forward to provide space at the bottom of the slope for Snowmobiler 2. Snowmobiler 1 then shut his machine off. When he looked back up the slope he saw Snowmobiler 2 separated from his machine and “log rolling” down the hill. He stated Snowmobiler 2’s machine hit a tree. Snowmobiler 1 initially thought Snowmobiler 2 had jumped off the snowmobile, but when snow impacted Snowmobiler 1 he realized Snowmobiler 2 had triggered an avalanche.</p>"

<p>A group of five experienced snowmobilers from North Dakota were on their last day of riding. G (46, dad) has been snowmobiling regularly in Cooke City since 1999 with upwards of ten trips a year. He and his group had all the latest rescue gear: beacons (Tracker 2), shovels, probes, airbags (BCA Float 22) and had avalanche awareness training. Three were expert riders and two were advanced. They knew the avalanche danger that day was rated HIGH and A (19, nephew) got an Avalanche Warning alert on his phone from the National Weather Service that morning.</p>
<p>At approximately 1 p.m. the group was at the southeast end (aspect 130°) of Sheep Mountain. T (22, son) was sitting still on his machine at the base of the slope on a small ridge between two gullies. G rode up the southern gully, got stuck near the top and told W (39, cousin) through their helmet radios that it “...was not a good place to be!” in reference to avalanches. W was already riding uphill and cut above G. J (33, friend) followed ten seconds behind. With four of the five people either on the slope or in the runout zone, it is impossible to know who triggered the slide. We do know the slide was triggered low on the slope on terrain estimated to be 20° steep.</p>
<p>G was off his machine when the avalanche struck. After a few missed attempts to grab the handle of his airbag he finally succeeded and deployed it as he was carried down the hill. He was buried to his chest and unhurt, five feet from the edge of the debris. A was safely below and rode up the hill to help. G crawled on his hands and knees over the debris to T’s last seen point and saw his airbag sticking out of the snow. This took seven minutes. All three began digging with their hands and a shovel blade and had him extricated in five more minutes. T was facedown, head downhill, turning purple and fading out of consciousness. After getting him out of the snow they began searching for J who was located approximately 20 feet away. He was buried next to his sled, still tethered to it, with his head six feet deep and pointed downhill. Given his deep burial it is estimated that it took at least 30 minutes after the avalanche to reach him. Upon extrication they began CPR but resuscitation was unsuccessful. </p>
<p>NOTE: J had not deployed his airbag, which is not unusual. He was facing uphill when the avalanche hit, likely holding the handlebars trying to turn and outrun it. The fact that he was still tethered to his machine leads me to believe he was flipped and buried abruptly and not carried downhill very far. He likely did not have time to release the airbag.</p>"

Realizing he was in for the long ride, he took a whitewater-swim position, feet downhill on his back, and worked to stay on the top of the moving snow.  He tried to kick off his skis as they were pulling him deeper in the avalanche.  “The slide sent me off a large cliff and that’s when I began tomahawking,” tumbling out of control down the slope.  Skier 1 describes, “battling the river of snow“ while he inhaled snow into his lungs and was upside down at times.

<p class=""p1"">We went to ski the Pearl on Sunday. There was 3 to 4 inches of new snow on top of a crust that provided nice supportive booting up the line. I was in the lead the whole time and dug 4 hand pits on the way up. The snow in the lower part of the couloir was seemed to be bonded pretty well to the crust because the crust has not yet become a bullet proof surface. About 200 or 300 feet from the top I noticed that the snow was a little wind effected (now maybe 6 inches and had a slightly upside down feeling to it). It did not seem too concerning because it was still bonded to the crust in the same way that the lower snow was. </p>
<p class=""p2"">At the top of the couloir we all re-grouped and were moving close together (party of 5 total). I went up to the looker's left side of the cornice, it gets steeper here and is maybe 20' wide. Right as I neared the ridge the snow got much deeper in a soft wind slab (ie very new probably formed the night before did not feel as brittle or firm as they can be). I took a few steps away from the rocks on the looker's left side heading toward the ridge and realized that I was walking into the wind slab. Right before it broke loose I said ""I just walked into a pocket"" and then it broke at my feet. It broke about 10 feet wide and the crown went from 4 inches to about 18 inches. The three of us who were at the top were not knocked down but [Skier 4] and [Skier 5] were about 15 feet below and were knocked off of their feet and carried maybe 400 feet before they stopped. They were not buried and did not hit any rocks. All that they lost was a pole and an ice axe.</p>
<p class=""p2"">The reporting member of the party summed up memorable factors contributing to the incident this way:</p>
<p class=""p2"">(1) a poor identification of the windslab hazard and (2) exposing our group all together at the top of the couloir (3) limited group discussion of the hazards</p>
<p class=""p2"">He noted that there are clear signs of wind-loading in a photo they took, and that there were numerous nooks in the sides of the couloir where a group could be tucked away and travel in a safer way, especially near the top.</p>"

The group ascended south-facing slopes and gained the summit of a sub-peak (shown as point 11,637 on USGS topographic maps) around 8:30 AM. This unnamed sub-peak is on the southeast ridge of Outpost Peak (locally known as Little Skiers Peak).  </p>
<p>The group planned to descend a southeast-facing slope on point 11,637 that drops into Pitkin Creek. Rider 4 skied down the ridge above the slope to a point where he could see the route Riders 1-3 planned to descend. Rider 1 began his descent moving down the slope just left of center. He skied about about 600 vertical feet and stopped at a large rock outcrop and group of trees, which was the group's predetermined meeting point. He waited for Riders 2 and 3 who descended near Rider 1's tracks. They stopped 40 feet to the right of Rider 1 in a tree island.</p>
<p>Rider 4 was above a steeper portion of the slope (around 40º) to the skier's right of where Riders 1-3 entered the slope. He started skiing from this position, descending around 150 vertical feet before Riders 1-3 saw the snow crack around him. Rider 1 called out via his BC-Link radio for Rider 4 to cut left out of the slide, but he was unable to escape the avalanche.  </p>
<p>Rider 4 fought to stay on the surface. He had an Avalung, but it was pulled from his mouth during the avalanche. As he was carried in the debris his left leg rotated violently, breaking his lower leg (spiral fracture). He came to rest after being carried downhill approximately 1350 vertical feet. He was laying face down, head uphill with his legs buried in the snow about 250 feet from the toe of the avalanche debris.</p>
<p>After the avalanche, Rider 1 called Rider 4 twice on a BC-Link radio with no response. Riders 1-3 all switched their beacons to search mode, and Rider 1 called 911. Rider 2 began the beacon search descending the avalanche path. Several hundred vertical feet below the meeting point, the avalanche path widened and Rider 2 noticed what he thought was Rider 4's backpack. After relaying this information to Riders 1 and 3 via radio, he noticed Rider 4 waving his arm.</p>
<p>Rider 2 quickly skied down to Rider 4, dug him out of the snow and began first aid. Both of Rider 4's skis had released, and were eventually found 200 to 300 feet upslope of Rider 4's resting location, along with one ski pole. Rider 4 was wearing a helmet, which sustained significant damage in the avalanche.</p>"

<p>Sometime late on May 28 or early on the 29th 2 guides and 4 clients were swept from their campsite high on Mt Rainier's Liberty Ridge. The 6 climbers tumbled down a 3,300-foot tall face and were buried on the lower glacier. After the climbers failed to return on the 30th, park rangers flew over the area on the 31st. They spotted camping and climbing equipment in debris at the bottom of the face. They also detected multiple avalanche transceiver signals, but because of dangerous snow, ice and rockfall they could not land. <br> <br> At this time it is believed that an avalanche swept the climbers from their campsite located between 12,400 to 12,800 feet, but the investigation is ongoing. A short-lived but intense storm hit Mt Rainer on the 28th bringing new snow and winds to the upper mountain that would have increased the avalanche danger. While there was no fracture line visible during the search operation, a fracture line easily and quickly would have been covered up by blowing snow.<br> <br> Park rangers will periodically fly over the area to monitor conditions in coming weeks and months, but recovery of the climbers is uncertain. <br> <br> For now this accident is being attributed to an avalanche based on circumstantial evidence of terrain and weather conditions, as well as direct evidence observed in the runout zone.</p>

The two skiers had checked the CAIC avalanche bulletin and were aware of the conditions. The avalanche danger was Moderate near and above treeline and Low below treeline. The party was aware of the fresh Wind Slabs that had formed on Saturday as well as the ongoing Deep Persistent Slab avalanche problem. The skiers were both carrying a beacon, shovel, and probe. Skier 1 was carrying an airbag.</p>
<p>The party reached the ridge of Yellow Mountain after 1:00 pm and assessed the Serpent Couloir. They watched a party ahead of them safely descend an adjacent couloir in the area. They could visibly see wind effects and fresh Wind Slabs on the northeast aspects of Yellow Mountain. After considering other options the party descended their original objective of the Serpent Couloir. Skier 1 descended to a knoll partway down the slope without incident. At approximately 1:30 pm Skier 2 entered the couloir, traversing to roughly the same area as Skier 1. While traversing from skiers left to right, Skier 2 noted that the snow became firmer and his skis did not penetrate the snow. On his initial traverse Skier 2 triggered a shallow hard slab avalanche 6-8 inches deep that broke about 10 feet above his skis. He initially was rode on top of the slab for 30-40 feet before it broke up, knocking him off his feet and carrying him down the slope. The avalanche swept past Skier 1, but did not come close enough to affect him. While being carried through the upper part of the couloir Skier 2 hit a rock and felt an impact on his left leg. He was carried through the remainder of the couloir, at times swimming to stay on top of the debris. Skier 2 came to rest on top of the debris as it exited the couloir and stopped on the “apron” of the slope. He was not buried by debris. Skier 2 could visibly tell that his left leg was broken from its position. Skier 1 descended the couloir with his beacon in search mode collecting Skier 2’s skis and gear that had been lost in the slide. Skier 1 reached Skier 2 and helped him into a comfortable position. Skier 1 descended the remainder of Waterfall Creek into the town of Ophir, where he made contact with San Miguel county dispatch as well as Telluride Helitrax. Telluride Helitrax assisted with the rescue, packaging and flying Skier 2 out of Waterfall Creek to a waiting ambulance. Skier 2 was then transported to Montrose Memorial hospital where he was treated for a broken femur.</p>"

<p>On March 11, 2014, a group of seven snowmobilers was riding north of Cooke City. In the morning they rode in meadows and on low angle slopes. By mid-afternoon three of them climbed onto a steep, northwest facing slope on Crown Butte. The victim stopped approximately 1/3 of the way up the slope just below the area that ultimately fractured. Two others were continuing to climb when the avalanche released. They turned downhill and barely escaped the avalanche. Many others including riders in other groups were in the run out zone and scrambled to get out of the way. The avalanche impacted the victim, carried him downhill and fully buried him. No one in the group of seven, including the victim, was wearing avalanche beacons or carrying shovels and probes. Other groups responded and began probing. Cooke City Search and Rescue located the victim about 1.5 hours later with avalanche probes. He was buried about 6 feet deep and excavation took additional time.</p>
<p>The avalanche broke 700 feet wide and 2-5 feet deep on depth hoar crystals about 1 foot above the ground. The avalanche ran 800 feet vertical and 1600 feet slope distance. Debris ranged from 5 to 15 feet deep and covered an area 900 by 400 feet. Slope angles in the starting zone ranged from 36-38 degrees. Alpha angle at the toe of the debris (angle from horizontal to the crown line) was 25 degrees at the northern lobe of debris and 27 degrees at the southern lobe. U.S. classification of the avalanche is HS-AM-D3-R4-O (hard slab, artificially triggered by a snowmobile, large enough to destroy a house, large in size relative to the size of the slope, broke within old snow).</p>
<p>At the time of the accident an Avalanche Warning had been issued by the GNFAC and the danger was rated as HIGH on all slopes.</p>"

This summary is an excerpt from the report.</p>
<p>On February 28, 2014 at approximately 1615 hrs, a snowboarder triggered a hard slab avalanche on a west facing, 35 degree slope of Mount Jumbo, located within the Missoula City limits on Missoula Conservation District land.</p>
<p>The snowboarder (#1) was caught by the avalanche but able to self arrest by digging in with the edge of his board and using his arms and fingers to grab the bed surface as the snow passed by.</p>
<p>The avalanche entrained most of the available snow in the fetch zone and accelerated as it advanced over a terrain convexity halfway down the track.</p>
<p>At the base of the ravine, the avalanche caught two children, an 8-year-old boy (#2) and a 10 year old girl (#3), who were playing in their backyard as it slammed into and destroyed a two story wood frame home. The two residents of the home, a 66-year-old male (#4), and his 68-year-old wife (#5), were inside the house when it was hit.</p>
<p>The two children saw and heard the avalanche coming down the ravine and ran downslope toward their home. Both were caught and carried several feet before coming to rest next to their home. #3 was partially buried, up to her armpits, and was able to dig herself out quickly. #2 was completely buried next to the house about 3 feet deep.</p>
<p>#4 and #5 were together in their home and were also completely buried under several feet of snow and debris from their destroyed home.</p>
<p>At 1618, Missoula City Fire, Police, Missoula County Sheriff, MT Highway Patrol units and local EMS teams were dispatched. A large contingent of well equipped neighbors with avalanche rescue gear soon began arriving on scene.</p>
<p>Rescue coordination was complicated by live power lines, broken natural gas lines and the very real possibility of another avalanche. The crown was not visible from the valley floor due to the mid-slope convexity and extreme weather that blocked visibility.</p>
<p>Spot probing began and a probe line formed near the home just below #2’s last seen point. He described being in the dark and unable to move his arms after being buried. He stated that he tried eating and chewing away at the snow until he became so tired that he fell asleep.</p>
<p>He was located 3-4 feet deep by a probe strike after approximately 55 minutes at 1709 hrs. When extricated from the snow, he was unresponsive. Rescue breaths were given and he was immediately transported by ground ambulance to Saint Patrick Hospital’s Emergency Department.</p>
<p>Rescue efforts then concentrated on spot probing and digging in areas directly below the last known location of #4 and 5. A neighbor showed rescue teams the probable location on the remaining foundation of where the couple may have been on a Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Probe teams were directed to concentrate on possible catchment features on the fall line below this area of the house. A probe strike was confirmed and #4 was located at 1758 hrs in a cavity under a brick chimney and a wall or roof partition approximately 4 feet deep. He was responsive and able to inform rescuers that his wife was 3 feet from him when the house was hit. He was extricated and transported by ground ambulance to Saint Patrick Hospital’s Emergency Department.</p>
<p>At 1907 hrs, #5 was located by a responding neighbor with a probe. An earlier probe detected a soft spot where a sofa was removed. This location was re-probed after a few minutes and a probe strike confirmed. She was approximately 25 feet below her husband’s location 2-3 feet deep.</p>
<p>She was breathing but unresponsive. Extricated at 1914 hrs, she was transported to Saint Patrick Hospital’s Emergency Department in critical condition. She died on March 3 from traumatic injuries.</p>
<p>Three other homes, several vehicles and an apartment building were also damaged by the avalanche. </p>"

It swept one 21-year-old women into the water of the creek at the bottom and buried her face down for about 40 minutes in the water.</p>
<p>She had no pulse when she was recovered but it was reported they may have recovered a pulse either in transport or at the hospital. Media report that she passed away today, February 9th.  Our hearts go out to the family and friends with this especially tragic accident.</p>
<p>American Fork Canyon has remained closed due to extreme avalanche danger and if it opens on Monday, we will have one of our forecasters visit the site and work up a more complete accident investigation.</p>

<p>It was a narrow, shallow gully with a stream at the bottom.  The avalanche descended just a short distance of about 50 feet into a creek, where the woman was buried face first in the water.  The Tibble Fork Resivoir area is a popular destination and trailhead and most of the terrain in the immediate area is fairly gentle.  But this particular, steep gully is between the reservoir and the main parking lot, just north of the road. </p>

<p>Craig followed a fairly standard up-track used by both public backcountry skiers and by UDOT forecasters, which utilizes a thickly-treed ridge between avalanche paths locally known as God's Lawnmower, which is just west of the ridge and Kessler Slabs, which is just to the east of the ridge. He ascended the ridge using climbing skins and made switchbacks up the northeast-facing ridge.  As he neared the top of the ridge where he was presumably planning to descend back down the ridge, his ascension track led around a sharp corner from the northeast-facing ridge onto a steep, east-facing slope where he presumably triggered the avalanche that killed him.  The flank fracture of the slab was directly on the sharp ridge that divided the safer snow on the northeast facing slope from what appeared to be recently wind loaded snow on the east facing slope.  The distance of only a foot or two separated safe snow from dangerous snow.  It's uncertain whether he was planning to make another switchback to stay on the safer north facing side and just stepped around the corner too far or whether he planned to continue onto the east facing slope to examine the snow there.</p>
<p>The avalanche was a relatively small wind slab, about 6-8 inches deep (a foot deep in the deepest section) and about 45 feet wide.  It was on a very steep slope, which was 50 degrees at the crown face and 45 degrees where his track led across the flank wall of the slab fracture.  It's likely that the avalanche broke 40' above him as he stepped onto to the recently wind-loaded slope.  The avalanche path descends through many sparse trees and over a couple cliffs.  The avalanche swept him 1380' vertical feet down the slope where he came to rest on the surface of the debris with his avalanche airbag deployed.</p>
<p>He checked in by phone around 1:00 or 1:30 in the afternoon when he was high on the mountain and reported stable snow conditions. He failed to check in later in the day nor return home that evening so the authorities were notified.  His UDOT truck was still parked at the Cardiff Fork trailhead. A Life Flight helicopter was able to fly just before dark to search for him and they noticed the avalanche with a person on top of the debris and not moving, but the terrain was too steep to land.  Ground-based rescuers from Wasatch Backcountry Rescue under the command of Salt Lake County Sheriff accessed the area on foot after dark.  They found Craig's body on the surface of the debris with his avalanche airbag deployed and obvious trauma to his head and hip with rips in his pants.  He was obviously still in ""uphill mode"" as he will had a climbing skin on his ski (the other ski was missing) and he was dressed lightly.  He was laying head downhill and on his side.   His body was only about 50' vertical feet above the toe of the debris.</p>"

It is unclear whether Climber 1 triggered the slide from below or if it released naturally from wind-loading, but given the start zone and the position of the climbers at the time of the avalanche, the trigger was most likely wind-loading. There were two pieces of rock protection in place (a nut and 0.75 Camalot) at the time of the avalanche. Both climbers took a very violent fall of approximately 100 feet hitting rocks and ice on the way down, at which point the Camalot arrested their fall with Climber 1 coming to rest about 30 feet above Climber 2. The nut pulled loose and was dangling from the rope after the avalanche. The avalanche debris mostly ran by the climbers but it did cement the rope into place and it was not retrievable.Climber 1 indicated that he was not injured and OK, but the coroner's report indicate minor injuries. Climber 2 sustained broken ribs, a torn MCL, a broken coccyx, and damage to her wrist ligaments.</p>
<p>At this point, the two climbers descended the lower portion of the couloir with Climber 1 walking in crampons and Climber 2 walking in crampons until she changed into snowshoes on the lower snow ramp.  Darkness had descended, and they walked approximately 1/4 mile from the bottom of the couloir and Climber 2 changed back to crampons to descend two small ice steps. They walked most of the way down a snow slope before Climber 1 was no longer able to travel on. Climber 1's level of consciousness began to rapidly deteriorate during this 1/4 mile walk. Climber 2 positioned Climber 1 in as sheltered and as comfortable position as possible, and then both of them spent the night of March 17th on the snow slope.

<p>A group of snowmobilers left 12 mile Canyon for a day of snowmobiling.  Just east of the head of 12 mile Canyon the group was playing in a broad flat bottom valley with small steep slopes on the west side.  The group was separated some what as everyone was having fun on different terrain features. At about 4 o'clock or a bit later the group noticed that one member was missing. They backtracked a bit to find a fresh avalanche and figured he must be buried in it. There was no sign of him or his snowmobile and he was not wearing an avalanche beacon. The group was not able to locate him and were forced to call search and rescue.  The search and rescue team arrived and was able to finally locate part of the buried snowmobile. The victim ended up being buried beneath the snowmobile and the rescue team extricated him but it was too late. The victim was a 30 year old male buried at least 4 feet deep.</p>

We attained the ridge a bit higher and more to the west then planned. We planned to stay in the trees located 100-200 ft to rider's left. We thought we could drop from where we attained the ridge and with a slight left traverse after the first low angle turns we could enter into the solidly treed area. Unfortunately, the slope contoured to rider's right, away from the trees and before we realized this we were too far right to safely traverse. There were two routes through a small cliff/rock band below us. Neither were desirable. We discussed hiking back up - very briefly. Another mistake. We opted for the route through the rocks to rider's right as the pitch was less steep and the slope featured a bench about half way down. I had done a couple of cuts and hard jumps above this area with no movement but did not try to cut this slope. I entered the pitch, made a single turn when the avalanche occured.

They described the results of their snow profile as ""moderate"" and decided to continue skiing. The group skied one run on the east-facing terrain just to the skier's right of the typical uptrack, and another on more north-facing terrain. During both runs the group did not see any cracking in the snowpack or observe any whumpfing. They skinned back up to the summit for a final run,  where they saw another party of three about to ski similar terrain.

All three party members skied about 1/3 the way down to a steeper rollover.  Skier 1 dropped directly onto the slope and made about 10 turns before traversing off to the side to wait. Skier 2 skied down toward Skier 1, stopping about 10 feet further downhill.  During Skier 2's descent the slope fractured and Skier 3 yelled warnings.  Both Skiers 1 &amp; 2 tried to move out of the way.  Skier 1 braced against a tree and was pinned up to his waist.  Skier 2 was able to move farther away and managed to stay upright as snow gathered up to his thighs.  Skier 3 watched safely from above, spotting his friends. Party members stayed in voice contact. Skier 3 helped dig out Skier 1, while Skier 2 dug himself out.
They all descended the debris and exited the area via County Road 10.  On their way out they noticed fresh avalanche debris 15-20 ft above the road. They decided to go back and investigate because the group of skiers they saw at the top of the run was headed in that direction. As they traveled uphill they met one of the skiers from the other group. This skier explained that all three of them had been caught in an avalanche. One of the members of his group was injured and the other was likely deceased.
Skier 2 left to notify the ski patrol at Silverton Mountain. After deciding it was unsafe to go back up the avalanche path, Skier 3 also left to go help find patrol, as he was more familiar with the ski area.  Skier 1 remained with the victim. 
Note: After pondering the chain of events, Skier 1 later commented that their snowpit location was fairly representative of the first lines they skied, but ultimately less representative of the slope that avalanched (the snowpit was on an easterly aspect near treeline).  The first two laps were also in more moderate terrain - less steep, tighter glades and without the steep breakovers. "

Unfortunately, the party only had one beacon, one probe and two shovels.  They started their search from the last seen point and realized the force of the avalanche pushed the victim off the bench the summer road was on and into a classic terrain trap: a steep gully.  They had a very good feeling where he was buried: probed all over the place, yet their probe could not reach the bottom of the debris (which in some places was over 30' deep).  There was a potential probe strike:  the party dug a six foot hole in this location...they were losing time.  Approximately 1 hr 45 min elapsed during this search and the party realized they were outmatched to find their companion.  They left and found cell service way down John Brown's Canyon on the way to Gateway.  The accident occurred around 10:30 am and Grand County Search and Rescue received the call on 2:00 pm."

Skier 1 was able to move one hand and could build a small air pocket. Skier 1 said he quickly knew he had to relax and slow his breathing down (it was very painful to breath with the broken ribs). He knew Skier 2 and Skier 3 would be down soon to get to him so he relaxed as best he could. A part of one ski was visible above the avalanche debris and it was still attached to Skier 1.

Avalanche danger rating: CONSIDERABLE with pockets of HIGH.
<br><br>
Events:<br>
The avalanche was remotely triggered by a skier from a safe, flat, ridged section of the slope just above treeline. That person felt a ""collapse"" which propagated to a higher elevation adjacent 37-43 degree slope and the avalanche resulted. Five skiers were stopped at this safe area and two were still hiking up in lower angle terrain below.
<br><br>
The debris overran a shallow depression and was deposited on a sub-ridge/bench terrain feature with sparse trees. The two skiers still hiking were in this lower angled terrain when the debris caught them. They were believed to have been carried 150-200' with one skier partially buried and one fully buried. The latter was buried under just inches to, at most, 1 foot of snow and wedged against a small tree. The five remaining skiers mounted an excellent quick and efficient rescue. Beacons were used to locate the skier fully buried when one person noticed a hand. At this point, they were able to clear the airway and the skier was able to breath on their own. It was estimated to take as little as 3 minutes, but possibly more, from the time of the avalanche to clearing the airway. The skier partially buried was able to dig most of himself out and help with the rescue of his partner. Both buried skiers were able to ski out on their own power.
<br><br>
Note:<br>
The debris from this avalanche nicked one small 50' section in the zig-zag of the 'relatively' safe up-track (where skiers were caught). A small section of the up-track was also covered with a very small amount (1' or less) of debris near the toe."

The party soon gained the northwest ridge of Kessler Peak and made a plan to descend West Kessler, also known as Little Giant.  The first person to drop in, a 25 year old male snowboarder, immediately triggered a 2-3' deep hard slab avalanche, carrying him an estimated 2400' vertical down the slope.  He was completely buried near the toe, or bottom of the slide.

Rising above 10,200', Kessler Peak stands abruptly above the other peaks in mid-Big Cottonwood Canyon and is surrounded by radical terrain and avalanche paths on all sides.  It harbors two significant avalanche paths that directly threaten Big Cottonwood Canyon and it was in one of these - Argenta - that the party chose to ascend the peak.  
<br><br>
The line that the party intended to descend on West Kessler is known as Little Giant.  It is a steep, convoluted series of chutes and chokes with many rocky outcrops and trees along the way.  At least one and perhaps two other separate avalanche paths converge into the lowest choke at a rough elevation of 9000'.  It was reported that the victim travelled over 2400' down this slope and was buried very near the bottom, or toe of the debris.

There is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger for triggering deep slab avalanches and a MODERATE danger for triggering any new or old wind drifts. Itâ€™s not HIGH danger anymore, but the travel recommendations remain the same. Iâ€™d avoid the steep west to north to southeast facing slopes at the mid and upper elevations.

Cooke City (7,600â€™) for a backcountry ski tour the next day. According to a friend they were aware the
GNFAC had issued an Avalanche Warning that denoted all slopes had a High danger in the Cooke City
area. Saturday morning, on telemark skis, they climbed a marked trail along Woody Creek out of town
following a set of ski tracks broken by local BZ and his partner.<br><br>
Approximately 1.5 mile into the ski A1 and B2 ran into BZ who was retreating because of the High
avalanche danger. BZ and his partner had triggered a slide on a steep 50 foot hill next to the creek
which buried his partner to the waist. They continued onward through open meadows, but turned
around at the Wyoming border because of the danger. They spoke to A1 first with B2 arriving half way
through the conversation. According to BZ, they told the couple about the avalanche they triggered and
the reason they were heading out. A1 and B2 continued a half mile further to the end of BZâ€™s tracks at
the border, at which point they turned on their avalanche transceivers. A1 was wearing a digital
Ortovox Patroller while B2 had a dual frequency F2 Ortovox with earpiece powered by rechargeable
batteries. The F2 was last made in 1989. After turning on the F2, A1 told B2 that the battery power was
not great.<br><br>
A1 was intent on following a route described in the ski guidebook, Nine Months of Winter, now out of
print. They broke trail up Hayden Creek for another mile through the flat meadow. B2 does not
remember seeing the avalanche BZ and his partner triggered, but she does remember widespread
collapsing as they skied. They were both nervous about it. Per the guidebook, they veered to the east
up a side drainage leading towards Index Peak. The terrain changed quickly from open fields to a 20
foot wide canyon bordered by 50 foot rock walls. They entered the narrow canyon and skied another
half mile. It was cold and windy and they wanted to eat lunch. A1 made a hard right turn (south)
through a break in the gully, an avalanche path, in search of a more comfortable spot. B2 followed a
few minutes behind. A1â€™s decision to go to the right might have been influenced by the guidebook he
was referencing. From their position in the creek with regards to avalanche danger, â€œto avoid slopes
fraught with more imminent perilâ€¦you can play it smart and ski into the trees on the right and make
your way up to the Basin in them.â€<br><br>
They went no more than a few hundred feet up the path when A1 saw a small avalanche and yelled a
warning to B2. They were both ascending the left side of the 50 foot wide path. She grabbed a tree.
She could not see A1, but assumed he did the same. The collapse propagated uphill and released a
larger avalanche above them. The avalanche fully buried A1 and just missed B2. The time was 1420.<br><br>
B2 skied uphill expecting to find A1, but soon realized he was buried. She turned her avalanche
transceiver on â€œreceiveâ€, put her earpiece in and started searching. She could only get a signal when the
volume was on its highest setting making it impossible to pin-point. Weak batteries were likely the
cause of this malfunction. B2 searched the debris and dug multiple holes in the snow. She spent until
approximately 1700 on the scene looking for A1. Getting dark she headed back to town solo. The dog
was buried too.<br><br>
In town, Cooke City SAR was already mobilized from another avalanche fatality involving a snowmobiler
earlier that afternoon. When B2 arrived she gave the SAR coordinators information on the avalanche.
Three snowmobilers headed into the scene that night, located A1 and extricated him back to town.<br><br>
For this report I interviewed BZ on Monday, January 4, 2012 while Eric Knoff interviewed B2 the night of
the avalanche. We also got many more details from the family in the days after the avalanche.<br><br>
A1 had 22 years experience backcountry skiing and B2 a few years. In the early 1990â€™s A1 took an
Introduction to Avalanches with Field Course offered by the GNFAC at MSU. B2â€™s avalanche training
was informal. The day of the accident both A1 and B2 carried avalanche transceivers and shovels."

Rider 3 stopped at the top of the drainage while Rider 1 and Rider 2 continued up the open face, angling right to avoid the steepest section of the slope. Rider 2 continued veering right onto a less steep sub-ridge.<br><br>
Rider 1 continued to climb up and left into steeper and more exposed terrain where he triggered the avalanche. Rider 1 was able to execute a downhill turn and was traveling down-slope when the avalanche caught him. He was carried 500-600 vertical feet downhill where he was entirely buried, except for the heel of his boot which was sticking out of the snow. His snowmobile was entirely buried, except for a small section of the right ski, approximately twenty feet below Rider 1.<br><br>
Both Rider 3 and Rider 2 witnessed the slide, but lost sight of Rider 1 in the debris. Rider 3 was near the bottom of the slope and deployed his BCA air bag as he watched the slide move towards him. Fortunately he was not caught. Rider 3 and Rider 2 turned their transceivers to receive and began a search. Rider 3 found Rider 1â€™s boot sticking out of the snow in a matter of minutes. After discovering Rider 1â€™s boot, Rider 3 descended the steep drainage and informed other party members of what had happened. During that time Rider 2 began shoveling out his father.

CPR had been in progress approximately 20-25 minutes before members of the Cooke City Search and Rescue arrived on scene. An AED was applied, but no shock was advised. At this time myself and partner arrived on scene. CPR was conducted for approximately 45 minutes before a physician in Cooke City gave notification to end CPR. Shortly after CPR was called off a member of the Cooke City search and rescue arrived on scene with a toboggan. The victim was taken to the Cooke City Fire Hall.<br><br>
Every member of the party was experienced in mountain snowmobiling and had ridden the area numerous times. Each rider carried rescue gear and knew how to use it.

We were following rocky ridgelines as much as possible to avoid the [potential avalanche] danger. We saw no signs for slides but with occasionally swift winds of 15-25 mph downslope all day, and some light snow, we knew it was advisable to be prudent. The previous week had seen consolidation of underlying layers, but there was evidence of some 4"" - 6"" of new snow in the Park as we drove in and as we moved above timberline. 
On the return we exercised caution, until we were at the final slope above the trees near Embryo Lake. I did not have my GPS with me this trip but we had been in the same area twice previously in the past month so we were familiar with the area. I pole probed the snow at the slope and saw no signs of slides in the zone, no sign of previous slide activity on this slope, and the run out was free of large boulders and trees. Everyone wanted to glissade the way down to the treeline and our trail back. I was the only three who has had avi training (Level 1 two years ago) and had my shovel and probe, but no beacon because I knew [the others in the party] had no avi gear and no training. Because I was still cautious, I asked them to let me go first and wait until they saw me clear before they began their descents. The going on my butt was slow at first, and I hardly needed my poles to brake my descent. But very shortly the convex slope turned concave and the angle increased. About the same time as I began to move a little faster the wind came from behind in ground blizzard force, and made the visibility hazy, as it was all white. I did have goggles one which helped me to notice that I was suddenly moving down at a pretty good clip, and then looked around to see many fracture lines and could see now what was happening. As I descended I swam backstroke style and then rolled towards the outer edge of the slide, attempting to exit it out the side before we bottomed out. But the concavity of the slope poured the snow toward a central location, like edges of a great tarp tipping inward and downward. I was on top swimming and felt focused and in the moment, but was yet surprised when I came to a halt at the bottom that the event was not over. In the last two seconds after my forward progress halted, the snow that had collected from behind me piled in and buried me except for my head and one arm. I was happy to be free of course, and began to dig out. I knew the [other two] were still above and could see them coming down around the perimeter of the wide fracture lines, as they did not want to risk another slide, since only a shallow 6"" or so slid. I managed to get my camera free and take some shots from the burial site up and in of the girls to the side, and that's how I know the time of the event. <br><br>
It was a soft landing and I'm happy the outcome was benign, but recalling the whole incident reinforces what I've always been taught, that the snow in a slide solidifies immediately upon coming to rest in a dense, concrete-like state that would not permit easy removal. I had my poles in the hand that was buried under 3' of snow and could have slid it free if necessary, but did not want to let go until my friends could dig me out because I thought I might not find them under the snow again. The [others] also dug out my legs and feet, which still had the snowshoes on."

A 31 year old NH man fell approximately 1150â€™ after triggering an avalanche in Mount Washingtonâ€™s Huntington Ravine on Thursday, March 10, 2011.  While solo ice climbing in the Ravineâ€™s Pinnacle Gully, the mountaineer began to climb down due to his concerns about unstable snow.  While descending, the slope fractured and avalanched, carrying him down the gully, through the approach area named â€œthe Fanâ€, to the Ravine floor.  Although receiving significant injuries he was deposited on top of the snow and was able to dial 911 and report his accident at roughly 10:45AM.  U.S. Forest Service Snow Rangers were notified and responded with the caretaker from the Harvard Mountaineering Club cabin.  Rangers traveled from Tuckerman Ravine on snowmobiles with rescue equipment and arrived on scene at 11:15AM.  The patientâ€™s injuries were stabilized, he was packaged into a rescue sled and transported behind a snowmobile to the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center where he was transferred to an ambulance and brought to Memorial Hospital in North Conway.
  
The avalanche danger for Pinnacle Gully on Thursday was rated at â€œConsiderableâ€ by the U.S Forest Service Snow Rangers at the Mount Washington Avalanche Center.  This rating was based on new snow being transported into Pinnacle Gully by south winds.  Between 7.3â€ (18 cm) and 8â€ (20 cm) of new was recorded from the storm before it changed over to rain on Friday.  It is unclear how much snow had fallen at the time of the avalanche, but field estimates were around 4â€ (10 cm).  Winds out of the south had been recorded on the summit of Mt. Washington in the 40 and 50 mph (65 and 80 kph) range since snow began falling around 2:00 am, Thursday morning.  The avalanche was triggered in new wind slab that was sitting on a rain crust.  The avalanche was classified as D2R3

Pinnacle Gully is a very popular three pitch snow and ice climb in Huntington Ravine.  It faces primarily east and slope angles vary from grade III water ice to snow slopes between 20 and 60 degrees.  Avalanche activity often occurs in the exit of the gully (start zone) or below the first pitch of ice on the approach.  We were unable to verify the exact location of the crown line of this avalanche due to unfavorable weather conditions.  The victim thought that he triggered approximately 3/4 of the way up the gully, which is about 400 linear feet of grade II-III ice climbing.

The victim described himself as being a competent ice climber who gets out 4-5x/week throughout the season. The climb was well within his technical ability, but we have no information at this time about his avalanche knowledge or training. His wife described him as a very cautious climber with regards to avalanches and was surprised by his involvement with an avalanche. The avalanche advisory for Huntington Ravine is conspicuously posted at the Harvard Mountaineering Club cabin each morning and was available at the time he would have passed by here."

A large sluff initiated on Rider 2's third turn. This turned into a soft slab, which propagated across the slope. 
Rider 2 saw refrigerator-sized chunks of snow breaking around him and tried to escape. He was tumbled and snow packed into his goggles, but he managed to get his board on his downhill side. The slide moved fast and Rider 2 could feel his board hitting trees on the way down the slope. He hit a tree with his chest, but was wearing body armor, which tempered the blow.<br><br>

LEAVENWORTH â€” A 28-year-old backcountry skier died in an avalanche on Mount Cashmere Saturday afternoon, March 5, 2011.
<br><br>
Z of Leavenworth was skiing with a group of people on the southwest face of Mount Cashmere above Trout Creek, when an avalanche swept him about 800 feet down a coulee and through a small group of trees, according to a press release from the Chelan County Sheriff's Office. No one else was injured.
<br><br>
People skiing with Z stayed at the scene in an attempt to save him, while others skied and rode snowmobiles out of the area to find cell phone reception. Dispatch records show they called 911 at about 4:16 p.m.
<br><br>
A Medstar helicopter and search and rescue team were dispatched immediately. By the time rescuers made it to an area north of Z's location, it was determined that he had died of his injuries.
<br><br>
Due to high avalanche danger and impending darkness Saturday night, mountain rescue personnel returned Sunday morning to recover his body."

Responding to the 911 call, which got routed to Gallatin County Search and Rescue (GCSAR), Bridger Ski Patrollers Pete Maleski arrived at the scene first, followed minutes later by Phil Scamma.  Excavating B2 was difficult because the hard slab debris was dense.  Nine minutes later they had B2 extricated, but he was deceased.  B2 was in a face down, head downhill position with his foot 1-2 feet from the surface and his head 5+ feet deep.  A1 noted that B2â€™s binding looked like he intentionally released it before getting fully immersed in the avalanche. 

The terrain in Truman Gulch is complex and the snowpack is highly variable.  Steep ridges and gullies lead into trees and over cliffs.  The terrain demands constant attention to navigate safely and even small avalanches can result in serious injury or death.  Sixty mph winds cross loading this terrain created hard slabs on the edges of gullies which further complicated snowpack analysis.  The avalanche broke above their highest point (did it break there or propagate to there?) and wiped out their two snowpits and area where they geared up to descend.

</p><blockquote> 
<p>Hi Steve--Per our conversation, here is a brief report of what I saw last week:</p>

<p>C skied northwest off the summit of the north summit of Lolo Peak, and dropped into the Lantern Lake Couloir.  We found his first ski approx. 500 feet down, where the couloir narrows and breaks into three distinct smaller gullies.  His ski was in the rightmost gully.  His body was located about 800 feet lower, in the talus.  He
was not buried, but there was ample evidence of wet slide debris all around him.  It appeared he had either been carried into the right hand gully, or was skiing that
gully when the avalanche swept him away.  Where he was found the slide path appeared to be about 50 meters wide.  It had the look and feel of a wet surface slide, and must have been moving very fast to have carried him so far (about 200 feet) over large talus blocks.  He died of blunt force trauma to the head; it is likely he had other major injuries as well.  He was not wearing a helmet, but based on the injuries I would say a helmet would not have saved him.  We found his other ski and a pole slightly buried about 30-50 feet above him.  He was wearing a
short-sleeved shirt and no gloves: we assume he was in a relaxed mode and  was not worrying about a slide.  He was not wearing a beacon.  When we found him on Friday morning, it had snowed approx. 1 foot since Monday, so it was difficult to tell exactly what happened, but the avalanche was obvious. </p>

This slab propagated from the far skier left side of the couloir approximately halfway across the top, and did not extend into the top of the main portion of the couloir.</p>

<p>Skier 1 was barely inside the skier right side of the slab and fell to his hip, facing downhill, and started sliding downhill. Very quickly, much of the slab had passed by Skier 1, who then slowed and nearly came to a stop. Just before skier 1 stopped, a second fracture occurred 10' directly above skier 1 in the top of the main portion of the couloir, and below the original ski cut. This fracture was about 4""-6"" deep and struck Skier 1 in the back, propelling him down the couloir and out of sight.</p>

<p>Skier 1 managed to stay upright most of the way down, and stayed on top of the sliding soft snow the entire way. About 500' down the couloir, Skier 1 began to tumble and lost one ski and both ski poles. About 750' down the couloir, below the apron where the slope flattens out, Skier 1 came to a stop on the surface with only boots buried. The residual sliding snow slid around skier 1 and came to a stop. Skier 1 stood up, retrieved the lost ski which had settled on the surface nearby, and walked to the edge of the debris field.</p>

<p>Skier 2 then skied on the hard and icy bed surface down to skier 1 and offered assistance, which was not required. Skier 1 had only suffered a minor leg injury. Both skiers skied out under their own power.</p>"

Ã¢â‚¬Å“The fatality was reported to park rangers around 2 p.m. on Thursday, April 1. The reporting party told rangers they had last heard from [the victim] at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, March 30 when [the victim] texted friends that he was on Mt. Shields (elev. 7131 ft.). When friends did not receive responses to subsequent text messages on Wednesday, they grew concerned. Thursday, a friend located [the victimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s] vehicle at the Fielding Ranger Station trailhead and skied up to Mt. Shields where [the victimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s] body was spotted high in a gully within the slide path of a recent avalanche. The backcountry party skied out and called park headquarters to report the avalanche and fatality.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>

<p>Details of the actual avalanche event are non-existent because the victim was alone. According to friends, the victim was very familiar with the area and snowboarded there quite often. Friends believed that that the victim had an avalanche transceiver, but neither his transceiver nor backpack were found.</p>

<p>Based on the investigation, evidence suggests that the victim completed two descents on the SSE ridge adjacent to the ski uptrack before beginning his descent down the NE slope (avalanche site) from the summit of Peak 6996. The victimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tracks intersect the avalanche debris from skierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right approximately 390 vertical feet from the summit below a short, steep convexity (elev. 6610 ft.). This entry point was approximately 250 feet below the highest point of the crown. Another 533 feet below that point, blood-stained snow was found among sapling sized trees (elev. 6077 ft.). Just below this point and to the skier's left, snowboard tracks exited the debris and descended to where the victimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s snowboard was found at 5868 feet. These tracks appear to be the tracks of the victim and the tracks that the reporting party stated he had seen when he found the victim. The victimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s snowboard was located by the reporting party and placed vertical in the snow at the location where it was found. Investigators located the snowboard approximately 210 feet below the exit track (elev. 5868 ft). The victim was found an additional 441 feet below the snowboard (elev. 5427 ft.). The victim was located face down on top of the avalanche debris with his head in the uphill direction. The toe of the debris was at an elevation of approximately 5080 feet and measured approximately 15-20 feet in depth. Based on the above evidence and measurements, it appears the victim arrested at around 6080 feet, traversed and descended on his snowboard skierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left across the slope to 5868 feet where he left his snowboard, and then descended the path on foot to his final point of rest at 5,427 feet.</p>"

As I started making turns, the second member of our party skied underneath and stopped. At that moment I made a turn over a convexity, and heard the second skier say, ""Oh ----."" There was an audible whumpf and the hill went. I was pulled onto my side but as I was near the top of the slide, was not buried. The second skier skied out of the slide to the right after being pulled down briefly. The spotter was unaffected by the slide. We also had a dog who was above the crack and was not in the slide. The slide lasted about 10-15 seconds. Nobody was injured. The slide ended as the slope mellowed out to about a 20Â° slope.</p>
<p>""The fracture line was on the convexity, about 17-25 cm deep. The slide was approximately 100 feet long and 20-25 feet wide. The slide consisted of new snow on top of a sun baked and wind slab harder surface. Indeed, the surface after the slide was quite firm.</p>
<p>""There were a number of human errors in this case. First, we were lulled into a false sense of comfort by earlier tracks from a previous party and the fact that we were below timberline. Second, we did not follow solid avalanche travel protocol by having two skiers in the chute at once. And finally, we did not do proper slope analysis. We read some signs - no whumpfing, no fracturing, and skied too aggressively. More research could have prevented this accident.""</p>"

This area is approximately 15 miles northwest of Fairfield, Idaho and is often accessed from the popular Chimney Creek trailhead. Two riders were climbing the west side of Pt. 9538 when a slide started above the uppermost rider. A third rider watched as moving snow overtook the first rider and the second rider turned to the climberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left and out of the slide. The slide carried the victim over a thousand vertical feet downhill and buried him four to five feet deep next to his snowmachine; the debris continued several hundred vertical feet further downhill. The party quickly regrouped, located the burial site with a beacon and dug deep enough to provide an airway within an estimated 25 minutes. CPR was unsuccessful. The SS-AMu-D3-R2 avalanche was 2 to 3 feet deep, approximately 300ft wide and ran over 1300 vertical feet. Prior to the accident, the Soldier Mountains had received over 3Ã¢â‚¬Â of Snow Water Equivalent and roughly three feet of snow since January 12. Moderate to strong southerly and westerly winds had accompanied the snowfall, with wind speeds peaking five days before the accident. The mid-January snowfall fell on an unusually weak layer that had been a concern the entire season. A widespread natural avalanche cycle had occurred in much of the advisory area the weekend prior to the accident, and a smaller avalanche had claimed the life of a skier a week earlier; the local and regional press had covered that accident extensively. On the morning of January 28th, the Sawtooth National Forest Avalanche Center (SNFAC) had identified the avalanche danger as Considerable because of the recent loading on the persistent early season weak layer.  That dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advisory urged extra caution on steep rocky slopes due to the persistent weak layer buried at the base of the snowpack, recommended that people avoid travel on slopes steeper than 30 degrees, and expressed concern about the sunny, warm conditions forecast for the day."

A skier triggered a hard slab avalanche that broke several hundred feet above him. He was caught in the avalanche, swept over several cliff bands, and down 1400 vertical feet. He was partly buried-critical, with just a hand above the avalanche debris. Another party witnessed the avalanche. They saw the hand and had the victim's face uncovered in 5 to 7 minutes. A helicopter training at the ski area transported the victim to a waiting ambulance.

THE AVALANCHE
Bear Creek is popular out-of-bounds terrain adjacent to Telluride Ski Area. The victim, on skis, was riding with a companion on a snowboard. The morning of the incident, the pair left the ski area and entered Bear Creek. They made a run on a slope locally known as E-Ticket/Needle's Eye area without incident. They returned to the ski area and ascended for a second lap. They noted many other backcountry travelers in the area. Telluride Ski Patrol estimated over 80 people skied in Bear Creek by noon on the 29th. To avoid descending on parties, or have other parties descend above them, the pair decided to ski a more committing line just skier's left of their previous run.

The Needle's Eye avalanche path starts on an east facing alpine slope at about 12,600 feet. The skier entered path along a convex roll above a steep rocky area, about 200 vertical feet below what would be the crown. The skier likely triggered the avalanche near the bottom of a windslab, where it thinned out, and the fracture propagated uphill into thicker slabs before avalanching.

The victim saw the snow at his feet breaking up. He skied towards a rocky area in an attempt to escape the avalanche. He was very close to the edge of the moving snow when a wave of snow rode over the rocks, overtaking him from above. The victim continued to fight hard to escape. He remembered going over two cliff bands before blacking out. The avalanche pulled off both skis. One binding released while the other was ripped out of the ski completely.

RESCUE
A party of two witnessed the avalanche. The two split up, one to search the upper debris and one to search the lower. The upper searcher saw the victim's partner making his way down the bed surface and told him to switch his beacon to search mode. As the lower searcher began his beacon search, he saw the victim's hand above the snow (partly buried-critical) and quickly cleared about a foot of debris down to the victim's face. The victim had been buried for 5 to 7 minutes. Initially, the victim was unconscious and not breathing, but he began taking breaths on his own after snow was removed from his mouth. No resuscitation was necessary. Other parties in the area also came to help and assisted in digging out and stabilizing the victim. Using cell phones, rescuers called Telluride Ski Patrol and the sheriff's office. Helitrax and Telluride Ski Patrol were training on the ski area. The helicopter and several ski patrollers were dispatched and stabilized the victim on scene before transporting him to a waiting ambulance.

The victim was wearing extensive safety gear, including a full-face helmet, knee and elbow pads, padded shorts, and a padded chest and spine protector. Nevertheless, he suffered critical injuries, including 5 broken vertebrae, a severely broken scapula, several broken ribs, and a punctured lung. He required a 4-night hospital stay, though he expects full recovery. The victim believes his safety gear contributed to his survival.

While the rescue was taking place, another party triggered a smaller slide. It was in the Nellie avalanche path, at an almost identical aspect and elevation to the larger avalanche. The Nellie path is just north (down canyon) of the Needle's Eye. No one was caught.

No other signs of instability were noted by the victim's party nor the primary rescuers prior to the slide, though both parties noted recent windloading. The victim and his partner had skied in the vicinity for the three previous days, but had never skied this particular run before. Neither the victim nor his partner had checked the avalanche advisory that day. They both had some formal avalanche training, and each carried a beacon, shovel, and probe. The victim was on telemark skis. His partner was riding a snowboard."

A party of three planned on spending a few nights at the Eiseman Hut, which is part of the 10th Mountain Division Hut system. They hiked to the hut on Thursday, January 15th. On their way into the hut, the group encountered a group returning after three nights at the Eiseman hut. When asked if they had left any untracked snow for the group of three, the group exiting the area said they ""only left skin tracks"". The group of three arrived at the hut in time to check out the area and take a few runs on west and north-facing slopes. They did not dig any snowpits. That night, they shared the hut with another group of 6 or 8 people.

Over breakfast on the morning of the 16th, they discussed a plan to ski a face on an unnamed peak (Peak 11,754). The plan was to head up to the top of another unnamed peak to the north of the hut (Peak 11,770). From there, they would descend into the valley bottom, head to the west, and ascend the west ridge of the unnamed peak (Peak 11,754). They carried ropes and climbing harnesses so that they could belay each other into the start zone in order to safely dig a snowpit and assess stability. They discussed their plan with the other hut visitors, who said they were not going to that area due to the recent and visible avalanche activity on the slope in question.

The group of three left the hut at 0900 with an established plan in place. At the summit of Peak 11,770, they looked to the ENE at an untracked slope and decided to change their plan. They also noticed two natural slab avalanches on the portion of Peak 11,754 that was their main goal for the day. The two natural avalanches appeared to be a few days old. A portion of the face between the two natural avalanches remained intact. The group established a new plan to continue up the ridge to the summit of a third unnamed peak at the head of the South Fork of Sandstone Creek drainage (approximately 12,320'). They chose to ride a west-facing line near the north end of the broad summit and then continue down the valley and intersect the route from their original plan.

After descending the slope, they regrouped in a safe zone. Boarder 2 remembers looking at his watch, the time was 12:10. While preparing for their next climb, the group changed their plan a second time. Instead of heading further down the valley to ascend the main ridge, they decided to climb a slight subridge that runs up the center of the face. There are trees growing along this subridge, and the group hoped the trees would provide some margin of safety.

They began to climb up the treed subridge and quickly realized that the slope angle went from about 20 degrees near the base to over 40 degrees near the top. There is an abrupt transition near the bottom of the slope where the slope angle changes. They discussed the steepness of the upper part of the slope and if they should dig a snowpit to assess the snow stability. They decided to continue without additional snowpack observations. Boarder 3 took one step forward and heard a large WHUMPF. Then the slope started to move. All three were climbing with the mouthpieces of their AvaLungs and bit down on them as all three quickly started to move downhill. They all came to rest fairly quickly, only being caught in the debris flow for about 20 vertical feet. All three were completely buried.

Skier 1 was pushed into the trees and was buried head up, facing uphill into the trees. His hands and feet were in front of his body, with poles and skis still attached. His face was about a foot under the surface. He bit down on the mouthpiece and relied on the AvaLung for just a minute or two, until he could clear the snow away from his face. He was able to move a little and talk to Boarder 2 as they were only about 5 feet apart. Because he was facing uphill, he had trouble moving the snow and was unable to dig himself out. ""While I was buried, I remember thinking to myself that if I was facing downhill, I would be able to dig a lot easier."" He was buried for 1 hour and 20 minutes and recovered by Boarder 2. He lost his sunglasses in the avalanche.

Border 2 ran downhill and, for the most part, avoided the trees. He, too, was buried in a sitting position, facing downhill. His head was 2 to 3 feet deep. He could not really move his right arm because the ski pole was still attached. His left pole strap had slid up to his elbow and was able to dig, initially with that hand. Although he was buried for about 1 hour, he only used his AvaLung for ""about 5 breaths"" because he was able to move enough snow that he could see light. He eventually completely dug himself out and went on to recover Skier 1 and Boarder 3. He claimed that he would have been able to get out sooner if he would have been able to release his feet from his board (split at this time) with the homemade quick release system that is installed on his other snowboard. He had no injuries and lost no equipment.

Once out of the hole, Boarder 2 quickly pulled out his shovel and dug out Skier 1's head and chest, and then turned his attention to Boarder 3. He found Boarder 3 by talking to him through the snow and quickly realized that he needed help digging him out.  Boarder 2 yelled to Boarder 3 through the snow, saying that he needed to finish digging out Skier 1. Boarder 2 returned to Skier 1 and finished digging him out of the snow. Boarder 2 and Skier 1 then dug Boarder 3 out of the debris.

Boarder 3 was pushed down into the trees like Skier 1. He was buried sideways, facing downhill, on the uphill side of a tree. He was buried 6 to 7 feet deep. He bit down on his AvaLung so hard; he left permanent marks in the mouthpiece. He used the AvaLung for approximately 15 minutes. He used one hand to cover his face and the other to increase the size of his air pocket. He said, ""The AvaLung is one of the reasons why I am alive today."" He also said that if it were not for Boarder 2, ""I'd be dead."" From shuffling around, an air hole appeared, and he could see light. He could not really move because his ski pole straps were still attached, but was able to move one hand some because the pole broke just below the handle. His worst injury was from being hit in the head by a shovel. ""Thank god it was a soft slab."" He was buried approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes (the length of Boarder 3's burial was determined with the aid of digital photo timestamps). He broke one ski pole.

The time was 1430 and they dug out Skier 1's skis and Boarder 2's splitboard. They took some photos, and descended down into the valley floor out from under the avalanche path. They ate, drank, added layers and then headed back to the hut. They arrived back at the hut just before 1700. They discussed the accident with the other hut party and went to bed. They decided to hike out the next morning instead of staying one more night.

They did not need to use their probe poles or beacons for the rescue. Each member of the party was recovered through voice communication.

COMMENTS
From the group members:
Skier 1 said that the most significant thing that he learned was to pay closer attention to natural billboards. ""We talked about the natural avalanche activity but ignored it.""

Boarder 2 said that he will never use his ski pole straps again.

Boarder 3 said that that he would follow his gut better and to pay closer attention to recent avalanche activity. He said ""I had a bad feeling right when I put my snowshoes back on."" He also said that he thought of the rapid warming, but did not really listen to it.

From the investigators:
""FACETS"" or Familiarity, Acceptance, Commitment, Expert halo, (Scarcity or) Tracks and Social Proof are heuristic or decision-making ""rules of thumb"". Research has indicated that if we use heuristics to base our decisions on, then we may fall into a trap. ""FACETS"" represent the most frequently occurring ""traps"" for backcountry users. The average number of ""traps"" present in avalanche accidents occurring in the United States is 3.5 (out of 6) per accident.

""ALP TRUTh"" or Avalanche activity, wind Loading, avalanche Path, terrain Trap, Unstable snow (collapsing/cracking), and Thaw instability are visual clues and or indicators of avalanche hazard. In many circles, this is an accepted method for identifying avalanche hazard. Recently, discussion has come up about the preventative values stated in the original research. Regardless, the Obvious Clues method can be used as a tool to aid the backcountry user in identifying various indicators of avalanche hazard. In this accident, there was little emphasis was given to the recent avalanche activity.

Current information: Cellular phone coverage is available at several of the backcountry huts and yurts in Colorado. This hut, in particular, tends to have pretty good coverage, and the group could have called the local avalanche hotline in the morning before their tour.

Education: Two of the members of this party had successfully completed backcountry avalanche safety courses. Both took a Level I and a Level II course from the same instructor during the same winter. Although we encourage everyone to seek as much education as possible, it is important to remember that both education and experience help you evaluate avalanche conditions and make good decisions. In many ways, our education begins when we exit our first avalanche class. Avalanche classes give us a structured way to make observations and start gaining experience, but they are no substitute for days on the snow. Please take a class, spend time in the snow, and then take another class. Repeat as needed. As André Roch (Swiss mountaineer and snow scientist) once said, ""the avalanche does not care that you are an expert"".

Rescue: Finding a person in avalanche debris through voice communication is possible, but unusual. Digging yourself out of 3 feet of avalanche debris and surviving a burial of 1 to 2 hours are both very, very unusual. There are several factors that probably contributed to both the unusual and positive outcome of this accident. First, the group's location at the time of the avalanche. They were near the bottom of the slope and were not carried very far in the debris flow. This may have reduced the amount of compaction in the debris and made it easier to dig through the snow. Second, the nature of the avalanche debris. The group described the snow that they dug through as sugary and loose. This probably allowed Boarder 2 to extricate himself from the debris and help the other group members. This probably also helped them speak to each other and breathe under the snow once they had stopped using their AvaLungs. In general, avalanche debris becomes very dense, and it is difficult to move any portion of your body. Boarder 3 described the snow directly around his body as firm and wet, but the snow in general as sugary and loose. Third, the group was well equipped. Although the group's decisions on their route and the avalanche danger in the area certainly contributed to this accident, they were well equipped, and this likely saved their lives. The AvaLungs probably assisted or allowed for their self-rescue, and they all carried beacons, probe poles, and shovels as well.

Outcome: The bottom line is that three backcountry users were completely buried; they self-rescued, all three victims wore AvaLungs (used them) and are here to tell their story!"

Skier 1 dropped off Skier 2 at the top of Ptarmigan Peak with the expectation of picking him back up on a logging road on the north side of the peak.  Both carried radios.  Skier 2 began descending northwest of an area known as the Muffin Tops as Skier 1 got ready to take the snowmobile down the road.  Unexpectedly, Skier 1 received a radio report from Skier 2 that he had been caught in a slide and had broken his leg. Skier 2 was unable to give an exact location, but reaffirmed he was northwest of the Muffin Tops. 

Previously in the day, these men were scheduled to rendezvous with another group from Summit County.  The schedules did not line up, and the Summit group had left the Vail Pass area before Skiers 1 and 2 headed out.

Knowing that the Summit group contained three ski patrollers from Diamond Peaks and Loveland, Skier 2 called them on his cell phone.  The summit group was still en route to Silverthorne with their sled, so they turned around and headed back up the pass. When the three patrollers arrived at the top of Ptarmigan, they gathered info from Skier 1 and began a search for Skier 2 (the victim).  Snow conditions were unstable, and the patrollers were unfamiliar with the terrain, and it was getting dark.  The decision was made to one-at-a-time ski the least dangerous terrain and perform sound sweeps in an attempt to contact the victim.  
After around an hour and a half of searching, the patrollers entered a series of open meadows directly west of Ptarmigan Hill.  In one of those meadows, a patroller saw the crown of the slide that the victim had triggered.  When the patrollers yelled out, the victim replied and the patrollers toured in his direction and made contact.
The victim was in a semi-snow cave that he had dug out of the debris field.  He was moderately hypothermic and in pain.  The patrollers relayed their position back to Skier 1, as search and rescue had been initiated by this time. 

The patrollers delegated medical, command, and rescue between themselves.  Medical assisted the victim with clothing and splinted an obvious deformed fracture using a skin wrapped in a spiral around the leg.  Command ascertained a safer location for the group as they were initially under hangfire.  He also coordinated between the on-site group and search and rescue members en route over the radio.  Rescue began assembling an emergency toboggan using his skis (they were much fatter than the victims).  Using the toboggan, the victim was removed from under the hangfire, and the patrollers began hauling the victim toward the road Skiers One and Two had planned on meeting on.  While pulling the victim in the toboggan, Beaver Creek Ski Patrol arrived and assumed command as well as chastised the patrollers for their ""banter.""  It should be noted that the victim's opinion on the matter was asked, and he thought said banter was rather enjoyable.

While negotiations and communication between field command and operations commenced, the victim's hypothermia worsened.  It was decided that a fire should be lit, so one of the patrollers and some helpful search and rescue members gathered wood and started a roaring blaze.  According to witnesses, the victim's improvement was immediately noticeable, and he even started ""steaming"".  Meanwhile, the field command assigned the two other patrollers to recon a potential road for snowmobilers to use for access.  As it turns out, rescuers below on the road saw the fire and climbed up from the road.  A lightweight backcountry sled was brought in, and the victim was lowered down to a cat that had assisted in the rescue.

The victim was taken to Vail Valley Medical Center, then later flown to Denver Health for a fractured pelvis, fractured tib/fib, and compartment syndrome secondary to a ruptured vessel caused by the fracture."

A group of riders were playing at the base of the hill just off the groomed snowmobile trail below Shrine Mountain. They knew the avalanche danger was high so were staying off steep slopes. The group was on the trail, watching Rider A play. Rider A triggered a large avalanche. He was able to narrowly outrun the slide. The rest of the riders had to drive out of the way as well, because avalanche debris ran over the groomed trail. The whole group was equipped with avalanche gear.

COMMENTS
""False stable"" conditions occur when you assess the snowpack as stable when it is actually unstable. The term often comes up when snowpack tests indicate stable conditions - ""strong test scores"" - but the slope avalanches. Researchers report false stable rates of around 10 to 15%, depending on the snowpack test used (Birkeland and Chabot 2006). The results often occur in a persistent weak layer.

There are two strategies to minimize the chance of getting a false stable result: dig more pits per slope and use structural clues. The probability of false stable results in all pits decreases dramatically if you dig two or three well-done snowpits on a suspect slope. There are several useful structural clues that help identify potentially false stable conditions. Shear quality and fracture character are the simplest. High test scores with clean, fast shears (Q1, sudden planar or sudden collapse) warrant additional investigation. In snow profiles, Lemons (threshold sum method) will flag suspect layers. Details in these papers:

On the afternoon of Wenesday December 17, a solo 37-year-old snowboarder was killed in an avalanche approximately 2 miles northwest of Crested Butte. The avalanche occurred in an area known as the Happy Chutes. The soft slab avalanche ran approximately 1500 vertical feet through small trees, over a cliff and into a confined gully. The avalanche was large relative to the path (SS-AR-R4D2-O). The rider was traveling alone and the details of how the accident occurred are not known.

ACCIDENT AND RECOVERY
Sometime after noon on the 17th, the solo snowboarder ascended a ridge above the Slate River Valley and Peanut Lake. The victim frequently rode this area. With no witnesses, the actual series of events from this point remains unclear.

Search and Rescue efforts were initiated on the morning of the 18th. At approximately 4:00 PM on the 18th, searchers found a lone snowboard track off the ridge. The lone track led directly from the ridge into a recent avalanche, which strained through dense trees. Hazardous weather and dangerous terrain hampered the search efforts. On the morning of the 20th, a dog team and SAR members were brought to the valley floor, 1500 feet below the entrance track. One significant debris pile just reached the valley floor. This debris was from an avalanche in the next path to the north of the entrance track. Searchers found several pieces of the victim's gear in the path, and the victim was located in this debris pile following an alert from the dog.

Based on clues, the avalanche probably carried the victim through a dense grove of small avalanche-trimmed trees, over a 20-30 foot cliff band, down a tight gully, and finally into a stand of Aspen saplings. It is unclear how the victim came to rest in the next avalanche path over from the initial track, entering an adjacent crown. The victim was found lying supine, head downhill, beneath 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow without his snowboard or pack attached (neither were recovered), his jacket unzipped. The one recovered pole was extended fully. The victim was not wearing a transceiver."

The victim was last seen around 1 pm while skiing at the resort. Sometime between 1 and 3 pm, he exited the resort through a backcountry gate heading southeast of the ski area and entered backcountry terrain in an area known as ""Powerline"". Since he was traveling alone, the exact times and events leading up to the accident are not known.

The avalanche occurred on a NE aspect of Richmond Ridge. The crown of the avalanche, which was around 3 feet deep, was at 11,000 feet, located in a small open pocket in gladed terrain below treeline. The avalanche failed about 10 inches above the ground in a layer of 2mm faceted snow grains that were buried by our storm on Thanksgiving Day. The victim was carried 200 vertical feet down the slope before being buried in a group of trees.

Rescue efforts were launched around 8 pm by Aspen Ski Company employees after the victim was reported overdue for a gathering that evening. He was found by members of the Aspen and Snowmass ski patrols at approximately 9 pm. He was not wearing an avalanche beacon and carried no rescue gear. Patrol members located him by finding a ski on the snow surface. Just under snow near the ski, they uncovered his boot and began digging him out shortly after."

""Accident Summary
Skiers descended skiers left of the slide path with no incident. At approximately 9,800 feet the avalanche was triggered, propagated above the skiers to the steeper part of the start zone, 40*, and released. Subject 1 was swept approximately 400 vertical feet and buried with head and 1 hand exposed. Subject 2 was to the side of the slide and grabbed onto a tree and was partially buried. Each skier lost 1 ski and poles. A dog was not recovered. The initial ski tracks were left intact. A sympathectic release to the skiers right was much larger and entrained more snow than the initial slide. Subjects had skied similar neighboring terrain the previous day without incident, as well as previously that day. They had checked the avalanche report and discussed the hazard. Their thought process led them to believe they were away from the most loaded portion of the start zone, and protected by the treed ridge above them. The avalanche was triggered from below, propagating above the skiers. The initial slide was 50m wide running 1,400 vertical feet with an average crown depth of 2 feet and an alpha angle of 35*. The secondary release was much larger, approx 200m wide running 1,400 vertical feet with an avarage crown depth of 3 feet with some areas close to 5 feet and an alpha angle of 35* with the max angle in the start zone 42*.

Dave’s Wave is the name given to a terrain feature found in the backcountry between Arapahoe Basin Ski Area and Loveland Pass, Colorado. The feature is a vertical cornice that starts well above tree line at 12,800’ on the SE face of Pk. 13,117’. It is located near the midway point between Grizzly Pk. (13,427’), to the south and Loveland Pass to the north-northwest. The ridge line is the boundary between Summit and Clear Creek Counties, with the run located in Summit County. The known avalanche path goes from 12,900’ to the valley floor at 11,200’, but has not run full track in many years.

The start zone faces 190*S and turns to face 230*SW at the ""elbow"", which is near the top of another feature known as the ""Ironing Board"" near 12,200’. The start zone hovers around 35 degrees in steepness. Dave’s Wave is ridden 100s of times per season and avalanches approximately 3-4 times each season. This was the first avalanche in the path for the 07/08 winter season.

The run is clearly visible from Arapahoe Basin Ski Area and US Route 6. If you see ski or board tracks in the area, there is a bit of a ""rad"" component to seeing them.

Group:
Skier A~10 season veteran backcountry skier in the area. Skis between 150 and 200 days each season, mixing in area and backcountry.

Has backcountry skied many times this season, covering all aspects and elevations in the Loveland Pass vicinity.

Skier B~10 season veteran backcountry skier in the area. Skis between 150 and 200 days each season, mixing in area and backcountry. Has skied the same line 40-50 times before, and this was his second time this season. He also skied it back on 12/30 or 31 of 2007.

Jasper the dog, enthusiastic backcountry traveler.

Skier A and B ski together very frequently, are close friends, roommates, and communicate very well in backcountry settings.

These guys live to ski daily and work at night. They have more skis than furniture. More ski-related books, maps and photos than wood for their stove to heat their house. Ski addicts to the core. They are connected, known and respected in the community for their local knowledge and skiing ability. They are true ski locals. They each have nick names at their local ski area; A-Basin.

The Story:
Act 1:
Skier B called Skier A early in the am (Skier A spent the night at a friends), asking him if he would like to ski Dave's Wave. He also expressed that he wanted to get Jasper out for some exercise as the dog had not been out in a few days.

Act 2:
Skier A agreed with the goal and came home quickly to get ready for the day. They drove in two cars to make the shuttle easier, leaving one car in a pullout near the CDOT barn at the base of Loveland Pass and close to the bottom of Dave’s Wave. As they drove the other car up to the top of the pass, they discussed the current winds and altered their descent route to ski the ""Ironing Board"" instead. The Ironing Board is located just skier's left of Dave’s Wave. Terrain-wise, it is typically a safer line choice than Dave’s because of two main terrain factors: first, it is a slightly less steep line (low 30s) and second, is less susceptible to wind loading from west and north west winds. It does tend to get stripped from west and south west winds. It does, however, terminate at treeline where you need to choose between continuing down through very dense trees or exit to skiers’ right, back into the run-out gulley at the lower end of Dave's Wave.

Act 3:
They parked at the top of the pass and were hiking (carrying skis) up the ridge to the east of the pass by 10 am. They did not notice the recent activity. They acknowledged reading about the activity in the advisory, but did not see the signs. The winds at the top of the pass were moderate and cold. Note: I had driven up to the pass from the other direction about 30 minutes prior to skier A & B. Stopping at the summit, I noticed the recent avalanche activity and took photos of them. I quickly left the summit because it was cold and windy. I wanted to get out of the wind. Skies were the typical bluebird that Colorado is famous for.

Hiking up the ridge, there was little to no talking. It was the put your head down and keep moving scenario. Nearing the summit of the first 13er along the ridge, Skier A said to skier B ""this sucks!"" They were midway into a 45-minute to 1-hour hike on a highly elevated ridgeline that is very exposed to the weather. They arrived at the top of Dave’s Wave by 11:00 am. The winds had eased some, and the snow surface was ""full on sustrugi"". The first 500’ of the descent required the snow plow; full-on survival skiing techniques. They had skied the same line over 50 times together in the last 5 years.

Act 4:
Skier B made a ski cut from the top of the Dave’s Wave vertical cornice to skier's left (towards the top of the Ironing Board). Skier A then made a ski cut just above Skier B’s cut, both with no results. As they continued to descend, Skier A said to Skier B ""I’m crossing and I’ll follow you"" to the top of the Ironing Board. The snow surface was thin and full of exposed rocks. By about 11:30, they had skied to the bottom of the Ironing Board. Skier A skied first (one at a time), with B and the dog second/third. Riding conditions on the Ironing Board were excellent.

Skier B had originally thought of exiting to skiers left but quickly found ""sugar snow"". So, they decided to ""milk"" a few more turns because the snow was so good, by exiting to the skiers right, into the gulley below Dave’s Wave. Skier B went first and the dog followed. The snow was deep. Skier B exited into the trees near the bottom of the gulley and called up to Skier A to start his descent.

Skier A entered the gulley, and the snow ""was great"". He quickly approached the dog and passed him. Skier A actually said ""hey Jasper!"" as he passed. He too exited the gulley to the left. When he did, he turned to look up at the dog and noticed the avalanche coming down and engulfed the dog. He yelled at Skier B to back up into the trees. Skier A held tightly onto a tree while trying to keep an eye on the dog. The powder cloud closed down visibility for 20-30 seconds. Skier A noticed that the cloud felt more like facets than powder.

After the cloud settled, both skiers scanned the snow surface for the dog - no dog. Skier A quickly put on his skins and started climbing back up the gulley to the last seen location. Looking at his watch, the time was 11:53. They both started probing the gulley. One of the skiers has a 320 cm probe pole and hit the ground all but two times.

They called the ski patrol at A-Basin from a cell phone to say they were okay but were probing for their dog Jasper. Members from the Summit Country Rescue Group were paged prior to the call and deployed to the scene. The team made contact with the group and was told to stand down. Skier A and B discontinued their probe search for the dog at 4:15. They were back at the car near the CDOT barn by 4:30.

They were not aware of the sympathetic slide that occurred to the skier's left of the Ironing Board. Some maps call it ""Grizzly 2"". It is a ""Y"" shaped path starting above treeline and frames the Ironing Board with Dave’s Wave.

I asked them both separately how they would answer the decision-making trap and alpine truth questions. See how they answered them in the third image. Prior to each question, I explained what each ""trap"" meant.

I also asked what each would do differently?
Skier A said that he would not have skied into the gulley.
Skier B said that he would have skied directly down below the Ironing Board into the dense trees. He also said that he would consider getting two old frequency beacons to use when skiing with a dog."

A group of 7 snowmobilers left the ""Avalanche Campground"" trailhead at 1030 with the plan to ride as a group up to the top of Cottonwood Pass, 11.5 miles away. When they got close to the Pass, the plan changed due to visibility (snow and blowing snow). They played around in lower-angle powder-filled slopes below the Pass. The winds were blowing hard all day, ""up to 45mph"".

The victim, Rider C, has been riding for many years but is not an avid rider. He said that he has never owned a sled, only borrows from friends. He knows the Cottonwood Pass area quite well.

A little after noon, the group decided to head back down and call it a day. A mile or so up the road from the accident site, they stopped to help another rider who was having engine trouble. Two other riders, from a separate group, arrived and offered to tow the stranded machine and rider to the trailhead. The group of 7 riders then blasted down the trail, communicating before they left to space out 200 yards or so, so they could drive fast. The groomed road in this area is very low angle with few turns.

Rider C was the third in the line of seven. Approaching the slide path, he said that he was not even thinking avalanche. He was driving at 45-50 mph and noticed a lot of blowing/swirling snow, and then it hit him. The time was approximately 1330 hours.

Right away, he thought to himself, ""I'm being hit by an avalanche."" The slide broadsided him, knocking him and his sled 35 meters to the south. He thinks he rolled at least two times while still holding on to the sled! The sled landed on top of his legs, but he was not in pain. He was sitting, facing downhill, head up. At this point, he tried to move to clear snow from his face and had trouble moving. He could not move his legs. His face shield was open as he wore glasses, and they were fogging up. His eye sockets, mouth, and ears were ""packed"" with snow. He was beginning to think that ""this was it."" Then he heard someone above him yelling his name. So he moved his hand, which, luckily for him, was visible from the surface. His friend grabbed his hand to assure him. His friends then dug him out.

He was buried for approximately 2.5 minutes with his head 1 to 1.5 feet deep.

The friend, Rider D, who was riding behind him, saw the avalanche happen and stopped. Then the others, Riders E, F, and G, pulled up. Rider 4 did not know how many riders were caught, so he took off down the trail to see if the other riders made it through. Fortunately, Riders A and B stopped about a mile past the slide to ""wait up."" Two of them turned around (including D) while one went to the trailhead to call for help. Back on site, D noticed a ski from Rider C's sled and ran over to the area while yelling for Rider C. He then saw Rider C's hand and grabbed it to reassure his buried friend.

Only 3 of the 7 riders had shovels and beacons. Fortunately, all shovels were at the accident site. The Chaffee County Rescue team assisted in transporting Rider C to the trailhead, where an ambulance was waiting.

COMMENTS
In 9 out of ten accidents, the avalanche is triggered by the victim or a member of the victim's party. This incident is one of the rare cases of a natural avalanche catching people.

About 11:30 on 01/04, a snowboarder was caught and killed in a large avalanche between Vail Pass summit and East Vail. The path is known as CDC. The terrain was steep, 35-39 degrees, with an east to east-north-east aspect just at treeline. The large hard slab was 2 to 7 feet deep, 130 feet wide, and ran 800 vertical feet (HS-AR-R4D3-O/G).  The slide initiated on an old bed surface, but quickly ran to ground. The avalanche carried the boarder over at least one cliff band and into a group of small trees. The other two party members quickly found the boarder, but they needed a rescue group to transport the victim out of the complicated terrain. The victim was the only party member on the slope at the time. All three party members were carrying avalanche beacons, shovels, and probes.

THE ACCIDENT
On January 4th, A, B & C exited the Vail ski area and hiked to the top of 11,816 ft Red Mountain, at the top of the East Vail Chutes. The day's weather was cloudy with light to moderate snow and moderate to strong winds from the west. A had skied the CDC path a couple of times already this season, and several times the season prior. He was familiar with the terrain, as was C. B had been into the East Vail area in the past, but not CDC. A looked at the CAIC forecast the night before and recalled that the avalanche danger below treeline was rated moderate. All three party members were carrying avalanche beacons, shovels, and probes.

CDC is an east-facing avalanche path, which is a sub-path within the larger East Marvins Bowl. It has a large, sparsely timbered terrain fetch just upstream (Outer Mongolia at the Vail ski area), which provides ample snow for transport into the chutes with prevailing westerly winds. The East Vail Chutes are well known for wonderful powder and are a very popular area for sidecountry riding. Many paths are loaded at the top, with either cornices or convex rolls. Starting zones often hang over cliff bands, dense forest, or small trees that have survived periodic avalanche activity. Many starting zones are in the 35 to 40-degree steep range.

A had a helmet cam which he set up and had switched on just prior to looking into CDC on January 4th. A talked about some of the terrain features in CDC and told both C and B to avoid the cornice a little further south of CDC. C provided a quasi-belay anchor for A, and A proceeded to stomp repeatedly on the convex roll at the top of CDC. After a number of jumps, A triggered a small, one-foot-deep hard slab (HSAScR1D1O) which ran to the top of the first cliff band, an estimated 100 vertical feet. This slide was about 30-40 feet wide. After it stopped, A told both C and B to stay on the bed surface to enter CDC. A then skied to the first prominent bench and pulled out rider's right, towards East Marvins. C rode second and pulled out just uphill from A.

B was the third member to enter the chute. While standing at the 1st cliff band above A and C, B was engulfed by the powder cloud of a large avalanche and was carried to a bench about 750 vertical feet lower down the slope. B was carried over 3 cliff bands and swept through numerous small pine trees before being buried about 4 feet deep, just uphill from the toe of the debris.

Both A and B narrowly avoided being swept up in the flowing debris as it swept downhill. A quickly switched his beacon to receive and picked up C, who was a little slower getting his beacon switched over. A moved uphill to search the debris deposited in the first bench while C moved down slope to search for B lower in the path. C located and began to dig B out within about 13 minutes of the accident. A arrived several minutes later and helped to dig B out. B was not exactly prone. It looked like his snowboard had acted as an anchor because it was deeper than his head. The pair began CPR, and the Vail Ski Patrol was notified.

The husband triggered a slab while high-marking the east face above treeline. The avalanche fractured on a wind-loaded east southeast aspect just below a cornice. The avalanche (SS-AM-R2D3-O) was 2.5 to 3 feet deep and about 450 feet wide. The slide ran roughly 450 vertical feet to a flat area near the bottom of the slope. The victim initially tried to ride out the slide, but was overtaken by the moving snow. The avalanche flowed over a bench mid-slope. Onlookers said the victim was airborne when he came over the bench, and then caught and buried by the debris. The victim had no avalanche rescue gear, nor did anyone in his party.

Luckily, onlookers with rescue gear witnessed the accident. As they approached the victim's sled, they noticed a small part of a boot on the snow surface. The onlookers proceeded to dig 2 to 4 feet down to recover the victim. The victim was buried for about 5 minutes. Initially, he had snoring respirations, but began breathing normally on his own. Once he ""came to"", the victim complained of an injured shoulder and abdominal pain. Grand County SAR members arrived on the scene and helped to transport the victim to the trailhead.

New snow and westerly winds combined to create unstable slabs on lee slopes. Observers noted that the slab broke on old snow below a cornice. One SAR team member noted whumpfing on the way to the avalanche, as well as fresh natural avalanches on similar slopes on the nearby Little Gravel Mountain.

Two skiers attempted to ski Mt Massive, a fourteener in the Sawatch Range. They left on December 30, 2007, at the start of what would be a two-week period of very active avalanche activity. They began the hike knowing that the weather would deteriorate throughout the day. They turned back early in the afternoon because of the weather. On their descent, a large avalanche hit them from above. Both skiers were caught and partially buried, and one was injured. The pair self-evacuated.

THE ACCOUNT
[Two skiers planned to ascend and ski Mount Massive, a fourteener in the Sawatch Range. The pair were in their early 20s, expert skiers, and both had taken a Level 1 avalanche class.] Skier B and I knew there would be high winds with strong snowfall over the course of the next 24 hours, starting late morning as we headed up the mountain on December 30th, 2007. [Skier A checked CAIC forecasts that morning, and many days prior.] We discussed several other options for our day, which didn't involve avalanche terrain, but foolishly kept our sights on Mount Massive.

We [used a snowmobile to access the summer trailhead and] began skinning up toward the SW route around 7:40 am. Our progress was swift and easy over many inches of fresh snow. Snow fell lightly with only very infrequent winds in the trees.

[At treeline] is a series of large avalanche paths which [start high on the mountain and roar] down 2500 feet to the valley floor. Many signs of scary snow pack were offered to us as we crossed small patches of deep snow. We made the assumption there was not enough snow up high for the [large avalanche paths] to run full length and therefore focused on the terrain under our feet, leaving the upper mountain out of our decision-making process.

The route ascends a large avalanche path which stretches up to the saddle between S Massive and Massive. We began making our way up the climber's left side of the path through rock outcrops and grass. We noted heavy wind loading on the south-facing aspects to climbers' left. This made us decide to cross the path one at a time to climber's right to ascend slightly raised grassy ridgelines running up the face.

The weather began to worsen at this point with strong gusts and heavy snow. A steady 10 to 20 mph wind blew; gusts may have reached 40 mph. The direction of the wind seemed to vary wildly, but it trended from the NW (from climbers' left and up the slope). Skier B and I discussed our turnaround time, which would be 1:10 pm if significant progress hadn't been made. We were around 12,300 feet. I skinned straight up the fall line through snow and grass on a mid-20-degree slope. Over the course of the next 200 feet of vertical, the wind dramatically increased in intensity. Skier B and I yelled back at each other that the decision to turn around was now (12:32 pm at 12,500').

We got a glance during a lull in the storm of the heavily wind-loaded opposite side of the gully. I pointed at it and said, 'That isn't good.' I skied first, heading down and south (skiers left) to the neighboring grassy bench, maybe 100 feet of skiing. Skier B skied to me, and then we repeated to another grassy rib, which was directly down the mid-20-degree fall line from the last stop. For the third section of skiing, Skier B skied first. We discussed meeting at a free-standing large rock 100 feet down and north across the main slope. This involved skiing to the right of some wind-exposed grass down a high 20-degree slope and then cutting right into a rock outcrop. This took us directly below the heavily wind-loaded slopes above. We likely followed this poorly chosen route because it followed our skin track. I mentioned meeting below the large rock for terrain cover, but Skier B said he would just ski up onto the rock. I agreed to meet him there.

After he skied down and onto the rock, I skied and stopped 5 feet to his right on top of the rock with a 20-foot drop on the downhill side. I remember looking down at my feet and seeing that a 2-inch deep crack had [shot to] the rock from my last turn.

I gazed up the mountain and saw the approaching avalanche through thick cover of wind and snow. The first thing I saw was a flute of snow shooting out of the gray wall of wind above the terrain we had just skied. The flute was moving incredibly fast, at least 100 mph and maybe significantly faster. It was probably 25 feet wide and 100 feet long. I swept my vision to the terrain directly above us while beginning to yell 'Oh sh!t' as my fears were solidified by an oncoming rolling storm of snow 30 feet tall and as wide as the visible slope, 'Avalanche!'.

It was 100 feet above us when I mouthed that final word, no time it's here. Luckily, I had the idea of a safe zone in my mind below the rock we were standing on. Without any thought, I jumped out and over the rock edge, trying to reach the ledge 20 feet below. My next memory is of being on the ledge on my hands and knees with copious amounts of light powder snow pouring over my body. In half a second (as I can recall, as time was very distorted), an unimaginable force of heavy snow pounded down upon me, flattening me into the ledge and then dragging me 40 feet down through the rock outcrop below. It felt like being under a towering waterfall. I distinctly remember thinking I was being buried as all light faded and the roar of snow surrounded me. Suddenly, light appeared and I struggled with my hands and feet to the surface of the snow.

Skier B has told me what he remembered during the slide. When I yelled 'Avalanche', he looked up, saw the slide, and then only had time (a second or less) to turn his back to the slide before getting blasted at high speed over the 20-foot cliff and a ways down the slope, landing on rocks on his back. Most likely, he flew 70 feet horizontally and 30 feet vertically through the air. He thinks his pack saved his back and head from serious injury, as it was between him and the rocks he landed on. Both his elbows are bruised and swollen from the landing. The snow then carried him another 80 feet down the slope, during which he thought he would be buried. He said his legs were buried. He was also thinking of me while under the moving snow.

I looked down the slope for my friend, who was struggling out of the debris 60 feet below. Both immediately in ""search for partner mode,"" we yelled ""HEY!"" in unmatched relief and disbelief. While emerging from the snow, Skier B was already pulling his beacon out to locate me.

I felt the shifting and clicking signs of a broken bone in my left leg, right above my ski boot cuff. Luckily, it's only a displaced break of the Fibula ¾ of the way up the calf.

Most of the slide debris lay below us on a bench above the headwall. The rest had run over and down the headwall to the valley floor. The largest cross-section of the slide I could see through the storm was on the bench and was at least 200 feet wide. This was a very large avalanche, [D4] from what I can match details to. The lower debris was deep and made up of large blocks of hard slabs jutting out at every imaginable angle. A 50-foot wide tongue of debris poured out of sight over cliff bands from the north end of the main debris field to what we could tell was the valley floor. From where I first saw the avalanche coming down on us to where it stopped was at least 800 feet. When I saw it, it was already moving at least 100 mph, meaning it started well above us, potentially 1400 feet above us, making the track 2200 feet long.

It was now 1 pm. With my leg as an unknown, we had to start making our way off the mountain. The hike out went as well as possible considering I was only able to use one ski. Once through some denser woods, I easily made it out by skiing on one foot down the skin track. We were back at the snowmobile around 3:45 pm.

Skier B and I are extremely lucky to have survived this. A broken bone and some bruises are so insignificant when I think about how much worse it could have been. The fact that neither of us was buried or seriously injured by the slide is pure luck. Our mistake was to even go out in avalanche terrain on a day like this one. When we turned around, it was the worst weather I had ever climbed in. Avalanche conditions were forecast moderate on the SW aspect above tree line, the morning of, and rose to considerable that afternoon. The cold temperatures of the previous two weeks had turned the entire existing snow pack into facets; depth to surface. A fresh 4 to 8 inches of moderate-density snow lay on top. Many times, the fresh snow fractured and slid on the old snow as we made our way through trees, willows, and around rocks.

Although we traveled as if in avalanche terrain, we only considered what we were walking over and never entertained the idea that a big slide was going to start above us. The storm hid the conditions of the upper mountain; out of sight and out of mind. Our efforts to avoid danger were trivial due to this oversight. We failed to recognize the rapid snow loading on the slopes 1400 feet above us.

COMMENTS
The pair noted two of the ALPTRUTh obvious clues, Unstable snow and Loading. They added a third clue, Path, as they crossed and skirted the edge of the avalanche path. They were using safe travel practices, but only for the terrain they were on. They ""focused on the terrain ... under our feet, leaving the upper mountain out of our decision-making process."" That was a critical mistake."

Both party members were experienced backcountry skiers, and each carried an avalanche beacon, shovel, and probe. They headed northwest to the Lost Lakes Chutes, which both party members had skied on previous visits. After two ski cuts with no results, Skier A proceeded to ski the slope known as Right Chute. After Skier A had descended roughly 150 feet, Skier B heard a large and very loud whumpf. He was surprised to see that nothing happened until several seconds later, when the slope fractured. He watched the snow break into 3 large pieces and begin their descent. He could no longer see Skier A at this point.

After the slide stopped, Skier A called up to Skier B, saying that he was OK. Skier A was partially buried, but was able to dig himself out as Skier B proceeded down a lower-angled ridge. Skier A had lost both skis, both poles, and one glove. Skier A knew he was injured and started making his way down the slope while Skier B did a quick search for gear. Skier B found one ski and brought it to Skier A. He also gave Skier A one of his skis and both of his poles so that Skier A was able to descend the slope with greater ease. The party proceeded to make their way 4.5 miles down to the Hessie trailhead, where they hoped to arrange for hospital transportation. Skier B, traveling on one ski, pushed Skier A, who was unable to move efficiently due to his injuries. The trail down was a well-traveled, thus hard-packed, winter hiking trail. They arrived at the trailhead roughly 1.5 hours after the avalanche released."

It is a very powerful account of an avalanche and the reflection afterward, and I am glad he allowed us to share. I have made only a few minor edits.

THE ACCOUNT
I am not a stupid man. Nor am I an inexperienced backcountry traveler. Yet on December 18th, 2007, I nearly lost my life to an avalanche while telemark skiing in a backcountry area known as East Vail, Colorado. There are several factors that led up to this accident that I'd like to write down, in the hope that others can learn from my mistakes, and so that I can learn myself, and express my thoughts more clearly.

I have spent the past twelve years skiing in Colorado's backcountry. By definition, the continental snowpack that exists here is full of weaknesses. Because we deal with such cold temperatures, moisture is often sucked out of the snowpack, leaving behind weakened crystals that cause avalanches. I know this because I have spent the past four winters and one summer working as a ski patroller dealing with avalanche mitigation at Keystone, Colorado and Queenstown, New Zealand. Since many Colorado alpine areas are above tree line with heavy wind, my work and recreational skiing has often dealt with hard slab formation. Hard slabs become a fact of life. I think that one contributing factor to the incident in East Vail was a feeling of familiarity and therefore comfort with hard slabs. When I went out onto the slab, I was trying to trigger instabilities and make the slope safer for my friends and I to ski. My miscalculation, based on previous experiences with the same slope, was that my ski cut would release a small, shallow hard slab up high and it would flush out below me, leaving me standing on top and ready to ski. That was wrong. A big hard slab with a four-foot crown ended up releasing above me with a lot of energy, propagating in both directions. As I looked to my right and then left, my second mistake was revealed.

I left myself no escape route. The terrain below me was a narrow choke, which caused the sliding snow to accelerate just as a river does when it approaches a narrow point in a canyon. I always thought that if I were involved in a slide, I would just point my skis straight downhill and get myself out of trouble. After this ride, I no longer believe that the mind is capable of processing information fast enough to accomplish what the body needs it to during a high-energy slide with a fast bed surface. I was at the choke almost instantly after the initial fracture, and when that happened the snow got real deep and real pushy real fast and knocked me off my feet. After that happened, I was in front of and under the snow, going for a ride.

It sounds strange, but at that point, I felt a real sense of calm. I felt acceleration and speed, but all I thought to myself was ""well, this is what it's like."" I knew that I had four of my best friends above me, and that they would find me quickly if I wasn't buried too deeply. I was getting pummeled by hard slab chunks, getting snow packed in my mouth, and then I was swept over the first cliff. It would seem like being swept over a cliff is a bad thing, but I think it saved my life. It gave me a couple seconds to clear my airway, and sort of get it together before the pummeling began again. I hit my head on a couple rocks while going over the first cliff, but didn't lose consciousness. I think that getting taken off the cliff also ""fluffed"" me back up to the surface, for lack of a better word. After the second cliff, I had the feeling of my right ski ripping off my boot. Soon thereafter, I felt the slide slowing down and starting ""swimming"" for the surface. I ended up on the surface, about 800-900 vertical feet below the original fracture, pretty shaken up but with no major trauma to my body. The slide continued below me, but at that point much of the original slab had been deposited on the two benches above the cliffs and it was more of a loose snow slide. I lost one ski, my hat and goggles, both poles, and my backpack had been ripped open and my shovel handle and probe were ripped out of it.

In the past week, I've been thinking a lot about the decision-making process that led to the accident. Years ago, I read an article by Ian McCammon about group dynamics and the role they play in avalanche accidents. It is a great read and can be easily found online at snowpit.com. Our group was five men and two women. The two women split off before our ski run and skied some mellower terrain further skier's left in Benchmark Bowl. That left us five guys. Skier A had seen a line through the trees lower in the bowl on the previous run, and we were trying to figure out the best way to get there. Skier A skied down to the first bench, but gave us the signal from there that the line he skied involved mandatory air with cliffs over 20 feet. We proceeded to move further to skier's right, past some old growth spruce that were ""safe"", but tracked up, toward the choke that Skier A and I had skied on the previous run. The plan was to ski down to the first bench, cut through the woods over to the left, and then meet back up with Skier A.

There were a couple reasons why I had a false sense of security. On the previous run, Skier A and I had cut in below and to the right of the pillow that would rip out on me, avoiding the ""sweet spot"" that I hit while cutting. On this run, we planned to ski a choke one over to the left from the one that Skier A and I skied. I had skied this very choke on several occasions in years past, once with my friend Skier M cutting in the same manner that I did when I went for a ride. I think that this is a red flag in terms of avalanche safety, basing a decision on experience from years past rather than making a critical evaluation of the terrain in front of you. It was my most critical mistake, and it's surprising that I made it considering that I usually approach things in a much more analytical manner. I think that's where group dynamics come in. I was with such a strong group that I probably had a tendency to let my guard down a little bit, figuring that they were thinking critically about the terrain and snow conditions and so I didn't have to think quite so much. This illustrates how communication within a group is critical for sound decision making. In reality, Skier B thought that the slab looked very ominous, but we didn't talk about it before I dropped in. Had we communicated, I may have done some things differently and not almost smoked myself.

In addition to thinking about the slide itself, I've spent the past week reflecting on life and death (of course), because realistically I should be dead right now. Many people have been in much smaller slides and not lived. I think the thing that saved me was being taken off the cliffs, but it still seems unbelievable. Another lucky thing is that while under and being transported I didn't get a hard knock and lose consciousness, even though my head was battered against rocks, stumps, etc. My friends thought I was gone for sure. The whole event still seems surreal. Skier C was the first one to get down to me and he was as freaked out as I was but still managed to give me a big hug. Lots of people seem happy I'm alive and that's nice. Medically, I just have a huge bruise on my leg that could have just as well been a broken femur, but am able to walk, ski, and breathe in and out.

When I close my eyes, I can still see that sort of weird color of blue that is the color of the snowpack when you are under it looking up. At the end of the slide before Skier C got there, I stood there realizing I was still alive and not badly broken. I just looked around, at the Gore range in the distance, the perfect Colorado blue sky, and just had a moment of perfect awareness or presence in the world. Maybe another way to put it is ""clarity"". I don't really have the vocabulary to describe the feeling, maybe the French do.

I'm still not sure what it all means, big picture-wise. If anything I am even more convinced of what Camus called ""the benign indifference of the universe"". I am overwhelmed by the love shown toward me in the past week by my friends. I realize that I have not spent enough time ""in love"". If karma exists, then I've just taken a huge withdrawal from whatever karmic account I had accrued, so I should be very nice to people for a while. That should be easy to do since I am genuinely happy just to be alive, which is a great feeling. Since I should be dead, everything from here on out is just a bonus. Life was always all a bonus anyway I guess.

Since I wrote this, two men have died in East Vail, just to the skier's right of the area that I discuss here. From all reports, their groups sounded experienced and prepared, just as mine was. I feel very sad for these men and their friends and families, realizing that it could have just as well been my friends and family going through such a difficult time. If you are their friends and reading this, my heart goes out to you. Though I wrote this as a personal piece for myself and friends, I've decided to edit it a bit and submit it to the CAIC, in case it helps other people think about their decision making process more critically. East Vail is dangerous and easily accessible, but also provides great backcountry skiing. We could all ski on green runs at the ski area and live long and boring lives, but they would be lives without adventure or challenge. I can't pretend to know how the other two men felt about backcountry skiing and riding, but for me, it's how I breathe."

""1"" traveled on a Splitboard, ""2"" on AT skis, and ""3"" on snowshoes with his snowboard on his pack.  All three carried avalanche transceivers, shovels, and probes. They were the first party in, and were navigating by compass. They reached treeline right below a slope that, ahead of time, they planned to avoid. They skirted along the edge of the trees because travel through the forest was slow. Skier 2 was about 50 feet behind 1, and about twice that distance ahead of 3. Skier 2 called ""look out"" in time for 1 to turn around and see the avalanche in motion. The avalanche caught 3, and missed both 1 and 2. The time was around 12:30 pm.

The pair quickly began their beacon search. They had a successful probe strike while pinpointing, and began to dig. They found 3's feet and snowshoes first. It took several more minutes to extract 3 from the debris.

After stabilizing 3's condition, the pair wrapped him in a sleeping bag that 2 was carrying. The pair moved 3 to the trees. Skier 2 then left to get help, and 1 began the slow process of sliding 3 down the skin track.  Other parties in the area assisted with the transport. Within three hours of the avalanche, 3 was airlifted to a hospital. Unfortunately, 3 never recovered and died in the hospital days later."

There was a close call early this season. Two backcountry skiers were in the Jones Pass area. They had made several runs in an upper bowl near the pass. On their last run, they moved to a smaller untracked bowl. They found ""bomber hard"" snow and were unable to break through when they jumped on it. The first skier descended along the skier's left side (looker's right) and waited at the bottom of the slope just before the end of the snow. The second skier entered the slope further to the skier's right. The skier triggered an avalanche on his third turn. The fracture propagated very quickly across the slope. The skier was able to struggle to the skier's right of the avalanche, and was almost free of the tumbling debris. Another avalanche ripped out along the right flank, catching the skier again. The combined avalanches carried the skier 2/3 of the way down the slope, and, fortunately, he was deposited uninjured on the surface of the debris.

The first skier watched in horror as two hard slab avalanches sped towards her. She had time to hunker down, and then was overrun by the avalanche. She, too, was fortunate and not buried or injured.

COMMENTS
The crown line shows the classic shape of cross-loading. The skiers descended along the shallower edges of the wind-pillow and effectively outlined the initial slab. Hard slabs are commonly triggered from shallow locations and then propagate into deeper areas. In the early season, sometimes the only areas that offer sufficient snow are cross-loaded gullies.

""Bomber hard"" snow can be attractive, because it keeps equipment off the underlying scree. Hard slabs, though, can propagate fractures along weak layers for long distances.

The secondary avalanche ripped to the ground. Tumbling over the underlying scree and rocks could be more hazardous than the avalanche. Rocks, stumps, and deadfall just under the snow are serious early-season hazards.

The pair may have been complacent. It is easy to imagine a thought process like this: ""It is early season, after all, and there was not much snow. The adjacent [lower angle and different aspect] slope was stable, so why should this little pocket be any different? The snow is super hard, which means it is strong. After all, it is a small slope if something goes wrong."" I can imagine the thoughts, because I have rationalized similar poor slope choices.

This was a classic early-season incident with a fortunate outcome. A combination of cross-loaded hard slabs and complacent skiers led to a good scare. It is a well-worn cliché, but bears repeating, ""If there is enough snow to ride, there is enough snow to slide."" Thinking about avalanche safety must begin with the first tour of the year. There was a similar incident in Canada on the 17th."

A party of seven was staying at one of the Never Summer Yurts. The avalanche occurred in the early afternoon of the third full day of the trip. Skiers 1 and 2 skied a chute adjacent to a broad north-facing slope. Skier 3 started down the broad slope. Several turns down the slope fractured. The avalanche caught and buried Skier 3. The first two skiers could see the toe of the avalanche and rushed over. On the way, they triggered a much smaller avalanche. The party began a beacon search and found Skier 3 in several minutes. Skier 3 was buried deeply, and the party estimated it took eight minutes to dig 6 to 7 feet down and reach his face. Skier 3's face was blue. Once the party cleared snow from his mouth and nose, Skier 3 began to breathe on his own. It took another 10 to 15 minutes to dig Skier 3 completely out of the snow. The party returned to the yurt, where they met an initial Search and Rescue party. Paramedics evaluated Skier 3, then accompanied him to the trailhead.

AVALANCHE
A party of seven skied into the Clark Peak yurt on Saturday, March 10. There were four men and three women in the party, all in their mid-20s. They were intermediate to advanced skiers. Two of the men had taken Level 1 avalanche classes. One member of the party was a former EMT, and another was a First Responder.

The party had skied similar aspects the day before and the morning of the accident. On March 13, one of the skiers ""caused two cracks in the snow around 11 am, but nothing slid"" on a north aspect. Skiers 1 and 2 cut a chunk of cornice and tumbled it into the chute before they skied. Neither the cornice chunk nor the skiers triggered an avalanche in the chute. Skier 3 dropped into the open slope around 1:30 pm. The slope fractured on his second turn. The avalanche caught Skier 3. He said, ""He floated until about the bottom of the slide when he was buried."" Once buried, he ""could not move, could not breathe, and just faded out.""

From the bottom of the gully, Skiers 1 and 2 could see the bottom of the avalanche. They traversed towards the initial avalanche and triggered a smaller slide on the way. The smaller slide was only 50 feet wide and ran a short distance. Skier 3 was buried near the toe of the debris, behind a brushy rise. He was buried face down, facing down the slope. His head was about 7 feet below the snow surface.

RESCUE
Skiers 1 and 2 began a beacon search. They had a signal pinpointed in several minutes. The party estimated it took eight minutes to dig down and reach Skier 3's face. His face was blue. Once the party cleared snow from his mouth and nose, Skier 3 began to breathe on his own. It took another 10 to 15 minutes to dig Skier 3 completely out of the snow. The party estimated that 20 minutes had elapsed between the burial and having Skier 3 completely out of the snow.

Once the party completed the beacon search and began digging, they dispatched Skier 4 to call 911. Skier 4 returned to the yurt, where she ran into a Never Summer Yurt staff member. The two skied to the trailhead and called 911 at 2:35 pm.

The initial Search and Rescue (SAR) party included Jackson County Search and Rescue, staff from Never Summer Yurts, and Colorado State Parks staff. As the SAR party snowmobiled to the yurt, they were met by another skier, Skier 5, who reported that Skier 3 was out and uninjured. SAR proceeded to the yurt, evaluated Skier 3, and snowmobiled him to the trailhead.

COMMENTS
This was a rapid, very well-executed avalanche rescue, especially for a deep burial. They sent a party member (Skier 4) for outside help ONLY after they had located Skier 3 and begun to dig. Skier 4 could correctly identify the location of the accident on a map, always important for SAR response. Once the situation stabilized, the party sent a second skier (Skier 5) out. This allowed the SAR party to relax because the situation was no longer a time critical rescue or medical emergency.

In hindsight, the party may have missed several clues about stability. Shooting cracks are an indicator of poor stability. One member of the party had seen cracks that morning on a north aspect. Wet surface snow from rapid warming is another indication of unstable snow, especially during the first warm period of the spring. Countering these clues were their experiences of the previous two days, skiing similar aspects, and no results on an adjacent slope."

Three friends were on a backcountry ski vacation in the Aspen area. They chose an ascent of Mount Shimer for March 13. They were ascending a treed, north-facing slope below Point 12,088. At approximately 1:50 pm, the lead skier remotely triggered a large avalanche in the bowl to the east. Just after this, a smaller avalanche fractured above the party. The avalanche caught all three, but the upper skier was only carried for approximately 100 feet. The avalanche swept the two lower men on split boards down the slope and buried both. The victims were buried one above the other, with about 100 feet between them. The skier found the upper victim first. After the skier dug the upper victim's head out, he continued the search for the second buried man. Once the second buried man was uncovered, the rescuer retrieved a cell phone from one of the victims' packs and made a call to 911. When Search and Rescue personnel arrived on the scene, they determined that both buried victims were dead.

THE AVALANCHE
Three friends were vacationing in the Aspen area. They were in their 30s and former graduate students from the Colorado School of Mines. On Tuesday, March 13, they selected an ascent up to Mount Shimer, locally known as Sunshine Peak, from a guidebook (Lou Dawson, 2000, Colorado Backcountry Skiing). All three had avalanche transceivers, shovels, and probes. One man used alpine touring (AT) skis, while the other two used split snowboards. On Monday, the three men checked the backcountry avalanche danger on the CAIC website. They dug a snow pit before ascending the slope that eventually avalanched.

The group neared the ridge at approximately 1:50 pm. The skier lead the way, traversing the steep slope, with the other two ascending the switchbacks behind him. Near the top of ridge the lead man remotely triggered the larger avalanche to the east. Then the slope under the men fractured. The second avalanche caught all three. The avalanche only carried the skier for approximately 100 feet, but the two men on split boards were swept down the slope and buried.

RESCUE
Self-rescue is the best chance for a live recovery. These men were well prepared. After the flow of the avalanche passed the skier, he removed his skins, switched his avalanche transceiver to receive, and headed down the debris. The skier found the upper victim first. After uncovering his friend's head, the skier continued to search for the second snowboarder. The victims were buried one above the other, with about 100 feet between them. The upper burial was at 11,030 feet, with the victim 7 feet (215 cm) below the surface. The lower burial was at 11,000 feet, with the victim 3.3 feet (100 cm) below the surface.

When the second victim was uncovered, the skier retrieved a cell phone from one of the victims' packs and called 911. The call occurred at 1500 hours. Approximately 1 hour elapsed between the avalanche and the 911 call. The Pitkin County Sheriff's office mobilized Mountain Rescue Aspen and sent a hasty team into the field. A Flight for Life helicopter from Summit County flew to the scene with a medic and snow safety expert. Mountain Rescue transported the survivor and victims off the peak to waiting snowmobiles. They arrived in Aspen just before dark.

Two snowmobilers were highmarking a southeast-facing bowl. The upper snowmobiler triggered an avalanche from a low-angle terrain feature. The avalanche propagated across the bowl. The lower rider had turned and was descending, and did not see the avalanche above him.

Events leading up to the Accident
On the morning of February 4, 2007, three snowmobilers headed up the Beaver Creek groomed snowmobile trail into the high country around North Mountain. An ungroomed side trail took them into a large east through southeast-facing bowl on the southeast shoulder of Point 12,494. They stopped on a large bench in the middle of an obvious large avalanche path. A recent avalanche (SS-N-R2D2-O/G) was visible on the climber's left side of the bowl. It had recently run in the period between February 1 and February 4.

While Rider 1 remained at the bottom of the bowl, Riders 2 and 3 began to high-mark the extreme right-hand side of the bowl. As Rider 2 reached the ridge, he triggered an avalanche that involved the entire right-hand side of the bowl. Unfortunately, the Rider 3 was unaware that an avalanche had been triggered and turned left into the bowl about halfway up. As he descended, Rider 1 at the bottom frantically waved to catch his attention, but the avalanche overran Rider 3 before he could avoid or outrun it. Rider 2 was not caught and raced to the bottom of the bowl.

Rescue
Rider 3's snowmobile came to rest at the toe of the debris, partially buried and still running. Initial rescue efforts were focused near the snowmobile. The group did not have any avalanche rescue equipment, but began to search immediately. At 11:16 AM, the Rio Grande County Sheriff's Office received a cell phone call from one of the party members stating that a party member had been buried in an avalanche. Rio Grande County Search and Rescue responded. One of the party members met Search and Rescue at the trailhead and guided them back to the location. At 2:10 PM, probing found the victim buried 4 feet deep, 8 to 10 feet south of his machine at the toe of the debris.

On January 6, 2007, at approximately 10:20 in the morning, the Stanley slide path near Berthoud Pass avalanched putting debris on U.S. Highway 40 (US40). The Stanley slide path crosses two switchbacks of US40. The avalanche debris pushed two vehicles off the upper section of the roadway and partially buried them between the two switchbacks. Five people were riding in one vehicle and three in the other. Witnesses initiated a rescue of the vehicle occupants. Staff members of the Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC), Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and Alpine Rescue Team were in the area and initiated an organized rescue of the victims and search of the debris. The organized search and evacuation of the victims was completed in conjunction with the Clear Creek Sheriff's Office, Colorado Highway Patrol and various emergency service agencies.

Rescue
The avalanche occurred at approximately 10:20 in the morning on January 6, 2007. Witnesses with cell phones on US 40 alerted the emergency services system almost immediately. The local 911 dispatch contacted CAIC and CDOT personnel who closed the road and traveled to the debris pile to begin search and rescue operations. The Alpine Rescue Team was conducting avalanche training with CAIC staff on Berthoud Pass that morning. They abandoned their training and headed to the accident site to aid search and rescue operations.

Avalanche debris completely blocked the road. The track of the Stanley path has three distinct branches. The two easternmost branches created piles of debris on the roadway. The vehicles were caught in the debris flowing out of the middle branch of the avalanche path. The avalanche pushed two vehicles off the roadway and down the steep slope between the two switchbacks of US 40. Witnesses of the avalanche initiated a rescue immediately after calling 911. Portions of the two vehicles were protruding through the debris, making it relatively easy for the rescuers to locate the vehicles and extricate the victims. One of the victims was partially buried in the car and could not be extricated until her seat belt was cut and removed. The windshield of the other vehicle was removed to create an exit for the occupants.

All of the victims suffered numerous bruises and small lacerations. One of the victims could not walk up the debris to the road and was raised up the slope by rescuers. This person was hospitalized, and media sources reported that the victim sustained broken ribs. All of the other victims were able to walk up to the roadway. They were transported from the site for medical care and released on the afternoon of January 6, 2007.

Historic Avalanches
The last time the Stanley Path avalanched and caught a vehicle was in 1988. The slide struck a van, pushed it off the road, and buried the driver up to his neck. Ironically, a few minutes before, the driver had heard a radio bulletin about the current avalanche danger. A natural avalanche struck and killed one motorist in 1945. Apparently, the avalanche occurred late at night."

A father and son team attempted to climb Torreys from the top of Loveland Pass via Grizzly Peak. They probably decided to turn back at some point while on Grizzly. From the ridge above the Grizzly 1 (also known as the Ironing Board), they thought it would be quicker to glissade down to the highway and get a ride back to the top of Loveland Pass than to retrace their steps. They started on separate routes down from the ridge and found that they were postholing rather than glissading. The son dropped in behind the father to be in his father's track. The son said he was about 100 feet behind the father when the slide went. They were both caught and tumbled 200 vertical feet down the slope. The father was mostly buried, with an arm and possibly a head out. The father was able to dig himself out after about 20 minutes. He heard his fully buried son yelling, and dug him out of the snow about 25 minutes after the avalanche. Neither was seriously injured.

ACCIDENT
A father and son pair planned to hike from Loveland Pass to Torreys Peak. This is a 4.4-mile trip, one way. They made it to point 12,396, or Grizzly Peak, before deciding to turn back. From the ridge, they thought it would be quicker to glissade down to the highway and get a ride back to the top of Loveland Pass. They started down Grizzly Bowl, but it became too hard to posthole in the snow, and the terrain got too steep. They backtracked to point 12,936 and walked a little further north along the ridge back toward the top of the pass and decided to walk and glissade down Grizzly 1 Bowl (Ironing Board). They started down on separate routes down from the ridge, and found that they were post-holing rather than glissading. The son dropped in behind the father, so he was in his father's track. The son said he was about 100 feet behind the father when the avalanche broke. The father said there were no indications of unstable snow, like collapsing or cracking, before the avalanche. Neither one had formal avalanche training, but the father said he was ""thinking about avalanches."" They did not know about the CAIC or the avalanche forecasts. They did not have avalanche rescue gear.

RESCUE
Someone on the highway witnessed the avalanche and called 911 at 1240. The father and son were ""tumbled a lot"" by the avalanche. The father remembers being tumbled head over heels and going through some rocks. The avalanche carried them about 200 vertical feet. When the avalanche stopped, the father was mostly buried, with his arm(s) and possibly his head out of the snow. He was closer to the bottom of the debris than the top. He was buried head downhill, with his head close to the surface and legs deeper. The father dug himself out in about 20 minutes. Avalanche debris completely buried the son. The father heard his son yelling from underneath the snow about 30 feet away, and dug him out in about 25 minutes. The son said he was buried on his side with his head downhill, similar to his father, with his head closer to the surface and his legs buried much deeper. After digging themselves out, the pair proceeded downhill to the south. They soon met with rescue group members coming up the hill. There was a significant amount of hangfire (snow that did not slide) above the avalanche. It would have been dangerous to expose rescuers to the potential hazard. Neither father nor son was significantly injured.

On December 21, 2006, two skiers were skiing in the Hanging Valley area of the Snowmass Ski Resort. The two reached the top of a ski run called Rayburn's Chute. There was a closed sign at the entrance of the chute, so they moved to the left over a cliffy area. This steep rocky area was covered with snow. About 15 vertical meters below them, there was a rock feature capped with the rootball of an old tree. They decided to ski down a narrow subridge and jump off the rocks next to the rootball.
The first skier descended the line and skied off the rootball jump with very little speed. He landed and penetrated into the snow with his skis. He then skied off the lower slope to the skier's left, toward a ski run called Lower Ladder. The second skier skied down the same line and carried more speed off the rootball jump. He landed approximately 2.5 meters lower on the slope than the first skier. His skis penetrated into the slope as well. He turned to the left to join his friend. As he skied to the left of the slope, an avalanche released. He tried to ski out of the slide, but was caught by the debris and washed through a stand of trees.

Rescue
The first skier yelled for his friend and began searching the debris pile. Neither were carrying avalanche safety equipment. After about 5 minutes of searching, four bystanders joined him and began searching. The group probed and dug with their skis and snowboards. Approximately 20 minutes after the avalanche released, the ski patrol arrived on the scene with rescue equipment. At about the same time, a fifth bystander also joined in the search. The fifth bystander was lower on the slope than the rest of the party. He walked onto the debris pile and began probing with his ski pole. Within just a few probes, he struck the helmet of the buried skier. The ski patrol and the group of skiers and snowboarders dug out the buried skier. They used first aid and advanced life support to attempt to revive him, but were unsuccessful."

Late Sunday morning, 2 snowmobilers from Iowa were buried and killed in an avalanche in the Trap Park area (near Trap Lake) of the Front Range -- about 3.5 miles ENE of Cameron Pass and 4.5 miles NNW of Poudre Pass (north boundary of Rocky Mountain National Park). The area is accessed from the Cache la Poudre Canyon via the Long Draw Road. There were 12 snowmobilers in the party. Seven machiners were caught, five partly buried and two fully buried; both buried riders were killed.

ACCIDENT
Some of the group had ridden the slope the week before, and on this fateful day, the group had already made multiple trips up and down the slope -- and the adjacent slope to the west -- immediately before the avalanche. When the avalanche released, one rider was at the top of the slope, one rider near the top of the slope who was able to ride across the growing fracture, one on the slope, and one waiting at the bottom to start up. The other eight riders waited at the bottom. Three riders at the bottom had their machines pointed downhill and were able to outrun the avalanche. The rider on the slope and the next rider in line to high-mark were buried. Five of the eight at the bottom were overrun and partly buried.

RESCUE
Only two members of the group were equipped with transceivers, and the group carried only one shovel and probe pole. Neither buried victim carried a transceiver. One member of the group -- from Canada and a member of a search and rescue group -- quickly organized his companions and started the search. Lacking collapsible probe poles, small trees were cut and stripped of branches and pressed into service. Companions did find one rider's buried machine. After about 30 minutes of searching, two riders were sent to seek help. At the trailhead, they met a Colorado Division of Wildlife officer who radioed the Larimer County Sheriff's Office. The first rider was found about 45 minutes after the avalanche. The second rider was found about 15 minutes later under his machine. He had been buried about 5 feet deep. A companion was sent to the trailhead with word that both victims had been found and that CPR had been attempted without success. Members of the Diamond Peaks Ski Patrol, Larimer County Search and Rescue Group, and Jackson County Search and Rescue evacuated the bodies.

At about 1230 hours Thursday afternoon, two teenage hikers were caught in a hard slab avalanche on the east side of Kelso Mountain, a little over 3 miles south of Bakerville and about 1 mile east of the summit of Torreys Peak. One young man, an 18-year-old from Colorado Springs, was buried and killed.

ACCIDENT
On Wednesday, the two teenagers (ages 18 and 17) had set out from Bakerville with aspirations to climb the Kelso Ridge (aka East Ridge) of Torreys Peak. The pair snowshoed up Stevens Gulch following the summer trail to the start of the route. The pair camped Wednesday night near the bottom of the climb. Strong winds racked the mountains and caused heavy blowing snow. By Thursday morning, the winds only grew stronger. With ferocious weather, the boys reconsidered their plans and opted for retreat. The pair packed up and started back down the summer trail.

Very strong winds made walking difficult, and heavy blowing snow obscured visibility. As the two traversed below the broad east side of Kelso Mountain, the boys were slammed by a wall of moving snow.

Carried only a short distance and near the edge of the slide, the 17-year-old found himself partly buried. His friend was gone. The boy wiggled himself free and left his pack as a marker. Seeing no clues of his friend and since neither were equipped with avalanche rescue transceivers or probes, he hurried off to get help. Somewhere along the trail, he used his cell phone to call 911.

RESCUE
At a few minutes after 1300 hours, the Clear Creek County Sheriff's Department notified Alpine Rescue Team, which mobilized a response. Through the sheriff's department, Alpine requested the Flight For Life's Avalanche Deployment, and the FFL helicopter from Summit County responded with a Breckenridge Ski Patrol avalanche specialist and an avalanche rescue dog and handler. Weather conditions prevented landing near the accident site, so the helicopter set down in Bakerville. The ski patrollers and Alpine Rescue Team members used snowmobiles to access the site. Above treeline, the conditions and deep snow made for slow going.

Some time after 1500, the Breckenridge Ski Patrol dog arrived on scene and quickly alerted on a spot in the debris. Probing was inconclusive, so searchers started digging. At times, the wind gusts were so strong that several rescuers were knocked over by the winds. A bit later, the dog alerted a few feet over, and probing confirmed the victim's location.

The victim was recovered from under 5 to 6 feet of snow. He had been buried for about 3 hours and 10 minutes. Rescuers recovered the teenager's body and returned back to Bakerville.

Late Sunday morning, a backcountry snowboarder -- a Denver man and a long-time rider in the Berthoud Pass area -- and his dog were buried and killed in a sizable hard slab avalanche on the north side of Mines Peak, just northeast of the summit of Berthoud Pass. This was the first Colorado and US avalanche fatality of the season.

ACCIDENT
On Sunday morning, three snowboarders set out from the summit of Berthoud Pass looking for powder. They climbed to the east and then traversed northward to the shallow bowl on the north side of Mines Peak (Mines Peak 1). Above treeline, they stepped into their boards. The first rider cut under the big wind-roll of drifted snow and rode to the trees just above where the gully starts. The second rider started down, followed by his dog, and was in the middle of the slope when the snow shattered like a pane of glass. In an instant, he was tumbled and swept away. The slide had broken out at the feet of the third rider. The time was about 10:30 AM. At this point, the details become very incomplete. The rider at the top returned to the summit of Berthoud Pass to get help. The first rider started searching for his friend.

Skiers and snowboarders organized a response and set out to help, while rescuers from Grand County Search and Rescue and Alpine Rescue Team responded. Several small groups of locals raced to the slide, but in their haste one group triggered a second sizable release on the adjacent slope (Mines Peak 2), and for a long time Sunday there was a very real fear that as many as 2 or 3 more people had been buried in this second avalanche.

RESCUE
Apparently, locals found the victim by spot probing near the toe of the debris just as organized rescuers arrived. The man had been buried for about 2 hours under 3 to 4 feet of snow. The victim had left behind -- either at home or in his car -- his transceiver. Efforts to resuscitate the victim failed, and Grand County Search and Rescue evacuated the body.

Rescuers from Alpine Rescue Team, Summit County Rescue Group, Flight for Life, and the Grand County and Clear Creek County Sheriffs' Offices assisted the rescue effort.

COMMENTS
A steep slope, a weak layer of loose, faceted grains topped by a fresh wind slab, only needed a trigger to set snow into motion. Tragically, along came a group of riders looking for powder. In the simplest form, it appears this accident was a case of powder lust, a dreaded malady that inflicts all of us who seek the steep and deep. All the necessary ingredients for an avalanche were present, and so too were the clues to the danger. The best clue was the strong winds and blowing snow that continued to load avalanche starting zones, even on Sunday morning. We have not yet spoken to the victim's friends, but we suspect that the hard snow conditions and earlier tracks may have caused false confidence.

A number of tracks were on the east edge of the slide, and we suspect those were put in late Saturday and maybe even a few on Sunday morning. Tracks are not a sign of stability and safety. Too often, backcountry skiers and riders were just lucky that they did not hit the weakest zone of snow. A couple of other lessons learned deal with hard slabs and early-season conditions.

Hard slab conditions on steep slopes should never be trusted. Recent weather conditions over the weekend -- strong winds -- were perfect for the formation of hard slabs.
Lastly, steep, high elevation northerly-facing slopes should never be trusted in the early season, as it is these slopes that will have the early-season weak layer. The dilemma is that these same avalanche-prone slopes have the snow and offer reasonable skiing and riding. The best advice we can offer is that we hope you will use extra caution on these steep northerly aspects and be patient in your pursuit of powder. A small avalanche can ruin a whole more than just your day or season.

At about 10:30 am May 20, a 53-year-old male skier from Boulder was buried and killed in a medium-sized wet slab avalanche at Arapahoe Basin. The avalanche occurred in an area known as the First Alley, immediately below the roll on the west side of the Pallavicini Run. This is the fifth Colorado avalanche death of the 2004-05 season and the 27th in the US.

RESCUE
The Arapahoe Basin Ski Patrol responded immediately and were soon joined by members of the Summit County Rescue Group. A portion of the victim's ski boot was spotted at the surface. A Flight For Life helicopter flew the man to a hospital, but he could not be resuscitated after a burial of about 31 minutes.
The search effort was suspended at 12:45 (Summit Daily News) because of the threat of additional wet snow avalanches caused by the high temperatures. By late afternoon, no other skiers or riders had been reported missing. Search efforts resumed the following day.

COMMENTS
Details are few at this time, but we will have more to report soon. While we wait on details, below is some information about ski area avalanche deaths and late spring/early summer deaths.

Avalanche deaths occurring in-bounds on open terrain are very rare; in Colorado, where nearly one-third of all US avalanche victims have died, such accidents are extremely rare. The last skier killed on open terrain in a Colorado ski area occurred back on January 9, 1975. A man skiing in the trees between trails triggered and was killed in a small avalanche at Crested Butte.

In the United States -- prior to this accident -- there have been only 4 other skier-deaths on open terrain since 1985. One death occurred in California (November 1985), another in Utah (February 1986); the third died in Wyoming (January 1999). The fourth fatality occurred this winter when a 13-year-old boy was blown out of a lift chair and buried in Nevada.

In Colorado, late spring/early summer avalanche deaths are also rare. From 1950/51 to 2003/04, 201 people died in Colorado avalanches. This winter has now claimed 5 (One fewer than average). Since 1950, only one other victim died in a May avalanche (5/22/1977, South Arapaho Peak (Indian Peaks), 1 climber killed). June avalanches have claimed 4. (6/13/1992, South Maroon Peak (Elk Mtns), 2 climbers killed. 6/13/1992, South Lookout Peak (near Ophir Pass), 1 climber killed. [Yes, the same day as S. Maroon Pk.] 6/18/1984, Elk Mountains (South of Aspen), 1 solo backcountry skier killed.) Two climbers have also died in July avalanches. For comparison, January, February, and March are the worst months with 42, 43, and 44 deaths, respectively. 22 people have died in April avalanches.

No accident occurred, no one was caught, but a bit of an incident ensued, and there are some important lessons to be learned by all. One of the skiers involved has posted a summary of events along with a sincere apology on the Teton Gravity forum (http://www.tetongravity.com/forums/showthread.php?t=28239). Reported below is what we have heard from rescuers.

On Wednesday afternoon, a group of 3 skiers remotely triggered a large and long-running avalanche in the ""Y"" chute, one of several prominent avalanche paths on the backside of Peak 6 in the Tenmile Range. This slide ran nearly to the valley floor. There was considerable confusion about this avalanche, and it seems the skiers likely never knew they had triggered the slide as they traversed well above treeline. The skiers continued their descending traverse to the ""K"" chute, where they triggered a second avalanche. The skiers called the Copper Mountain Ski Patrol to report they had triggered a ""big"" slide, no one was caught, all were okay, and that they had a good route out. Confusion arose because the patrol could see 2 slides, and the ""big"" slide (in the Y chute) was much bigger than the K slide. The Copper Patrol could clearly see the 3 tracks entering the smaller slide, but could see no tracks exiting, but the skiers had mentioned a big slide. The Summit County Sheriff's Office was notified and initiated a search and rescue operation.

With ski tracks in but no tracks out, rescuers from the Breckenridge and Copper ski patrols, Flight for Life, Summit County Rescue Group, and Summit County Sheriff's Office responded. Perhaps 20ish minutes after the first call, the Copper Patrol received a second call from the skiers saying all were off the mountain, in their car, and headed down the highway. The caller refused to answer any questions, saying he wanted to remain anonymous and hung up. This was an unfortunate event because a few extra minutes on the phone to answer truthfully where and how they had gotten out would have saved everyone involved a considerable amount of effort. Instead, the caller falsely reported they were safe and out, and on their way to Frisco when they were actually still on the mountain and a long way from the valley floor.
Confusion rose dramatically when some else reportedly called the Breckenridge Ski Patrol ""confirming"" 3 people were buried. Presented with conflicting information, the rescuers had to confirm that there were 3 tracks out of the avalanche. Ideally, it would have been even better to confirm the skiers were off the mountain before the search could be called off. Even if the call to the Breckenridge had not occurred, the rescuers would still want to confirm tracks out. With no visible tracks in the valley floor, the best way to check the avalanche would be from the air.

Flight for Life flew to the site with an avalanche specialist, an avalanche rescue dog, and a handler from the Breckenridge Ski Patrol. From the air, the crew confirmed tracks in but could find no tracks out. Because of the rugged terrain, the helicopter could not land on the debris or even get close to the debris. Also, because of significant avalanche danger, rescuers could not immediately enter the area from above or from below.

By now, the skiers had seen the helicopter and heard sirens, so they called back a third time to say they were out and okay, but they would not say where they were. The search effort continued because the rescuers didn't know where the skiers were, and couldn't find their tracks out of the avalanche or coming on into the valley floor.
Back in the valley, a meeting was quickly called by rescuers to plan their response. Avalanche reduction work with explosives would be needed to make routes and the site safe for rescuers. This effort would take time. While plans were being made, the helicopter flew back to the site with just the avalanche specialist for a closer look.
From the air came good news. Flying closer to the slope, the helicopter crew spotted some faint tracks and then spotted the three skiers hiding in the trees. About this time came a fourth call, and the skiers admitted they were still on the mountain.

After a while, the three skiers finally made it to the valley floor and the awaiting throng of rescuers, sheriff deputies, and the media. The Summit Daily News reported this morning that the trio were ticketed for violating the Colorado Skier Safety Act by ducking under a closure rope at the Breckenridge Ski Resort.

COMMENTS
Unfortunately, events for the 3 skiers quickly got out of hand. As mentioned earlier, a few extra minutes on the phone with a truthful appraisal of their situation would have resulted in a quiet and uneventful afternoon. They did the right thing when they called the patrol to say all was okay. We encourage folks to call authorities if they trigger an avalanche and think others might be watching, so an unnecessary rescue effort doesn't get started. (If there is any doubt, rescuers will always respond.) If, during the second call had the skiers had said they were still working their way down and would call when they got out to the cars, that likely would have been the end of the story.
If one ever calls to report a slide and to say there is no need for rescue, make sure you call back to say not just that you're out but also to add how you got out. Rescuers really like to be able to confirm that folks are indeed out and safe. In many cases, someone will likely check for the tracks to confirm the story. When the story cannot be verified, a rescue will likely start. In this incident, the tracks out could not be found, so the search continued.

In reading the first-person account, the trio's actions to continue down onto similar slopes after triggering an avalanche is interesting. What they did by continuing downhill was neither wrong nor right; for them, it worked. They got down safely, and it is probably what 99.99% of us gravity-loving skiers and riders would have done, but sometimes this action can lead right into the den of the avalanche dragon. Sometimes the better choice of action is to turn around and climb back uphill and return from where we came. Climbing back uphill also allows us to re-evaluate earlier decisions. We might decide to treat, or decide on a completely different route down, or on hot days, we can wait until the snow refreezes. (If you decide to wait, wait at least an extra hour longer than you think to be necessary to allow for a better freeze and stronger snow.) Once we start downhill, it is very difficult to change plans or routes. Gravity takes over and keeps pulling us down. If slopes become steeper or the snow is wetter, the avalanche danger goes up. Despite increasing danger, we usually continue downward bound because it seems easier to go with gravity than to work against it. However, sometimes it is safer to go against gravity.

On Friday morning, a 27-year-old Boulder man was buried and killed in an avalanche on Grand Mesa. He was backcountry skiing with a Grand Junction friend when they triggered the avalanche shortly before 11 a.m. This was the 2nd avalanche fatality on Grand Mesa. The other occurred on January 30, 1999.

ACCIDENT
After a week of winter-like weather, high pressure had moved over the region, and Friday morning dawned clear. Bluebird skies and fresh powder awaited skiers, riders, and snowmobilers. Two young men, one from Boulder (age 27) and the other from Grand Junction (age 26), parked their pickup truck on the shoulder of SH 65. Behind them -- about 150 feet -- was a CDOT avalanche-hazard area sign. Just up the road and visible from the parking spot was debris from an avalanche triggered the day before. While the men readied their gear, two CDOT employees stopped and advised the pair that they were parked in an avalanche area and that their ski plans were ""not a good idea"" because of the recent avalanche activity. The pair replied they would dig a snowpit and evaluate the danger.

The pair then set out. The Boulder man broke trail switchbacking up the 42-degree slope. He used alpine touring skis and skins; in his pack was a shovel, but he carried no avalanche rescue beacon. The Grand Junction man followed well behind on snowshoes, without a beacon or shovel, or probe. He wore only snowshoes and carried a camera; he did not have skis or a snowboard.

The Boulder man had skinned up through a small rock band and was near a small rock outcrop when he triggered the avalanche. He was swept over the rocks and down into the trees. The Grand Junction man was at a switchback when he heard the snow ""pop."" The avalanche fractured and released a few feet in front of and below him. He called 911.

RESCUE
Mesa County Search and Rescue Group responded from the Grand Junction area. After the 911 call, we are unsure of the Grand Junction man's actions, other than he returned back to the highway and flagged down two CDOT plow drivers, who were soon joined by three other CDOT employees.

The CDOT plow drivers immediately responded with their beacons, shovels, and probes. Unfortunately, the victim did not have a beacon. The workers found both skis in the snow and were feverishly spot-probing the likely areas. Once additional rescuers arrived at the site, spot-probing near the skis found the victim within 10 minutes, but it was too late. He had been buried nearly 2 hours.

CDOT mountain plow drivers are well-trained and equipped for avalanche rescue. The employees did an excellent job by quickly assessing the danger, organizing a search, and searching in the right area. He had been buried face down under 2 feet of debris in a spread-eagle position. He had been swept between some trees but did not appear to have physical trauma. It is presumed he died of asphyxiation.

COMMENTS
The signs -- literally -- of obvious avalanche danger (fresh avalanches, a road sign, piles of debris from a week earlier, and personal advice) were there. The pair's failure to recognize the seriousness and validity of these signs (or clues) and to adjust their actions to lessen their risk led to this accident. Avalanche accidents usually happen because of ignorance, arrogance, overconfidence, or distractions; the pair knowingly or unknowingly assumed a combination of these factors and put themselves into harm's way.

Ignorance can be overcome by getting educated and using the Center's forecasts. At least one of the men had some avalanche awareness, as they mentioned doing a snow pit. The pair may have seemed arrogant in their actions, but no one likes to be advised by someone else not to do something, especially when they have done it many times before. (We do not know if they had been in this area before.) Arrogance is best overcome when one realizes they can make mistakes. The pair was not planning on making a mistake, as they carried no rescue gear. Overconfidence is overcome by expecting the unexpected. On Friday morning, the pair did not expect to encounter an avalanche. And, distractions are overcome by focusing on the avalanche conditions.

This accident was most likely the result of ignorance and arrogance. Perhaps with more avalanche training, the pair would have had the knowledge to put the clues into the proper context. Unfortunately, their ignorance was compounded by their arrogance. Not carrying avalanche rescue gear on an obvious avalanche slope during times of obvious danger is a death sentence for a buried friend. A beacon, probe, and shovel in the hands of a skilled companion might have changed the outcome.

Everyone venturing into avalanche terrain should carry and know how to use avalanche rescue gear; however, we must remember that surviving an avalanche burial is more a matter of luck than skill and equipment. Therefore, we should travel as if we left our rescue gear at home.

At about 0930 hours, Easter Sunday, an experienced and well-equipped group of 4 backcountry skiers was climbing upslope on the east side of Point 12,118 near Jones Pass when a large avalanche released. The group was zigzagging low in the track of a path called Doctor 2. The group was probably at only about 11,100 feet when struck by the avalanche. Three skiers were caught, one partly buried, one buried but his legs were sticking out, and one skier was completely buried and seriously injured.

ACCIDENT
Two skiers quickly uncovered the one buried friend and then started looking for the missing skier. His cries from under the snow could be heard, but the trio needed their beacons to pinpoint his position. He was found after a short period of a few minutes under about 2 feet of snow. Worse, he had been swept into a stump along with a ""nasty looking sapling"" that had been fashioned [probably by previous avalanches] into a very effective lance.

He was quickly uncovered and upon seeing blood in the snow, the victim's wife headed out to get to get help. She met another group of skiers a short distance below in the big meadow. This group consisted of an EMT (a former professional ski patroller) and two friends who were also WFR trained (Wilderness First Responders). The trio hurried to the site while the women continued to ski down to the trailhead. She met a number of snowmobilers and with one returned back to the accident site and her husband. At some point, someone was able to contact 911 and the Clear Creek County Sheriff's Office. Rescuers from Alpine Rescue Team, Clear County Ambulance, the Sheriff's Office, and Flight for Life responded.

At the avalanche, the skiers -- now turned rescuers -- sized up the situation. The EMT quickly recognized the seriousness of the injuries: a very large laceration of the upper leg and fractures. Dressings, bandages, and splints were improvised, and the subject was moved to an improvised litter carried behind a snowmobile. He was transported to the trailhead and moved by ambulance to a Flight for Life helicopter and transported to a Denver hospital. The subject ended up with a fractured pelvis and a very large laceration that just missed his femoral artery. After hours of surgery, he is expected to make a full recovery.

COMMENTS
This accident appears to have happened to a very knowledgeable, well-trained, and well-equipped group that ran into bad luck. They were staying off steep slopes and were staying low in the track. Often it's a reasonable place to be. Even if they triggered the slide from the bench or from below, this would be a very unusual condition to encounter so late in the winter.

This accident, fortunately, has a happy ending and appears to be the result of training and practice along with some luck. It also demonstrates the value and importance of having strong first aid skills. We always advise people to get educated about avalanches, and if you spend any time in the backcountry, you and your friends should also get trained in wilderness emergency care. You never know when you might be called upon to help someone in need. Hats off to the skiers and snowmobilers who worked together to save the injured man."

At about 1220 Thursday afternoon, two climbers were caught in an avalanche on the south side of Quandary Peak. One man survived with only minor injuries while his friend was buried and killed. At 14,265 feet, Quandary Peak is a popular ""14er"" for winter climbers and skiers. Located at the south end of the Tenmile Range, the summit is about 6.5 miles SSW of Breckenridge.

ACCIDENT
The two climbers -- both male -- were friends via a church group. The survivor was from Omaha, NE, and the other from Colorado Springs, CO. They left at about 0830 and arrived at the Blue Lakes Dam at about 1000 hours. The pair left their snowshoes at the dam, strapped on crampons, and started up the Monte Cristo Couloir, which hits the summit from the south.

The pair were climbing at very different speeds. The Omaha man was climbing much faster. He remembers looking back at about 13,200 feet, where the slope is a bit less steep, and saw his partner below him and about 30 to 40 minutes behind. He waved to him, motioning that he was going to continue. At about 13,800, he heard and felt a big ""whumph."" The slope fractured about 30 feet above him. He instantly turned around but could not see his friend below. In the next second or two, he was swept from his feet and tumbled down the entire length of the couloir. He ended up on the surface at the very toe of the debris.

RESCUE
The survivor got to his feet and, not seeing or hearing his friend, set out to get help. Neither man carried avalanche rescue gear. He did not have to travel far, as he was soon able to call 911 with his cell phone from near the dam. At about 1240 Thursday afternoon, the Summit County Sheriff's Office received the call of the avalanche accident. Rescuers from the Summit County Rescue Group, Summit County Sheriff's Office, Flight for Life helicopter, Breckenridge Ski Patrol, Copper Mountain Ski Patrol, Keystone Ski Patrol, Alpine Rescue Team, and Red, White, and Blue Fire Department responded.

The buried man was found dead at 1630 hours by an avalanche rescue dog from the Breckenridge Ski Patrol. The victim was buried under 1.15 meters (5 feet) of debris.

COMMENTS
Over the years, Quandary Peak -- especially the south side -- has been the site of numerous avalanche and mountaineering accidents. On November 11, 2002, two climbers were caught and 1 was seriously injured when swept down the south side of the peak.

A lone backcountry skier was buried and killed on the south side of the peak on December 21, 1999.

At about 1445 hours Sunday afternoon, a 32-year-old man was buried and killed in a sizable avalanche in the backcountry near the Aspen Highlands Ski Area. At the time of the avalanche, the man was participating in a Level II avalanche-awareness class in Five Fingers Bowl. (Five Fingers Bowl has become a popular out-of-area ski tour adjacent to the Aspen Highlands ski area. Access is either from the top of Highlands Peak via a USFS backcountry access gate or to climb from the bottom starting at Conundrum Creek.) He was the only person caught.

Details are few, and what follows is preliminary and subject to change. We know the group had dug several snow pits across the top of the bowl as they traversed southward. Stability tests indicated moderate shears or what we might call ""so-so conditions."" The tests and pits apparently did not reveal obvious instability or stability. The group -- skiing one at a time -- was working their way down a prominent rib and gully below the ""thumb"" (point 12,495). A skier would ski toward the gully or perhaps even in the gully and then traverse back to the rib to wait for the next skier. The victim -- skiing third -- skied into or toward the gully and fell and rolled. This triggered the avalanche that broke some distance above him and swept him down nearly the entire track.

RESCUE
Words likely cannot describe the horror the group experienced watching one of their own swallowed up in a churning torrent of snow. They descended quickly but cautiously; at one point, they had to remove their skis to down climb a rock band. It may have taken as long as 20 to 30 minutes to reach the debris, and a transceiver signal was quickly detected. It was only a matter of minutes before they had pinpointed the signal and started digging. They found their friend under 3-4 feet of snow and started CPR for at least an hour without success.

Minutes after the avalanche, two members of Mountain Rescue Aspen were driving from Ashcroft back to Aspen when they noticed the fresh-looking avalanche. From the road and using binoculars, they were able to see ski tracks, including one track ending at the fracture line. They could not see the skiers and drove a short distance down the road and looked again. This time, they could see the skiers descending the debris. It was a short time later that their rescue pagers sounded with the report of the accident. They quickly drove to the ""trailhead"" and started up to help. The body was evacuated by the group and by Mountain Rescue Aspen. The Aspen Times website wrote that the Pitkin County Coroner's Office said the victim died from asphyxiation.

On Saturday, the 26th, two young Vail men (both 19) drove to Marble and toward the Yule Quarry. Their goal was to ski the main face--a huge avalanche path--on the northwest side of Whitehouse Mountain (11,975 feet). The year before, the two skied the same path and were looking forward to a repeat performance of excellent powder. Instead of hiking straight up the path--as they had done the winter before--the pair opted to skin up the west side of Whitehouse. They likely spent most of the day breaking trail up the more than 3,000-vertical-foot ascent, arriving near the top late in the afternoon. They traversed over to the north ridge at about 11,300 feet and continued upwards for another two hundred vertical feet or so. Just below the ridgeline -- at treeline -- they dug a snowpit.

It is unknown what they found or how they tested the snow layers, but they were satisfied that the snow was stable. By the time they were ready to start down the snow had stopped falling, and their spirits soared. The plan was to ski down a short distance by staying close to some small trees and then traverse to the far skier's right edge of the path and hug the trees the rest of the way down. This way, they would avoid some of the steepest terrain in the starting zone.

It was about 5 pm when the pair started down; after about 50 turns, they heard the menacing ""whumpf"" as the snow collapsed. Fractures shot out around and above them. Fractures shot far upslope, past where they had even dug their pit. In the blink of an eye, the slab was in motion. Both skiers grabbed trees and held on. Initially, the snow swept past them, but as the fractures propagated further upslope, more snow kept crashing down into them. After a few more seconds, they were both ripped from their trees and tumbled down the mountainside.

RESCUE
When the avalanche stopped, one skier ended up at the very end of the debris. Though he had tried to swim, he was shallowly buried with only his right arm out of the snow. Fortunately, only a few inches of snow covered his back and head, and he was able to dig himself out. Despite wearing a helmet, he still suffered a nasty head wound that would later require 12 stitches. He could not see or hear his friend, so he started a transceiver search. The prospect was daunting. Battered from the violent ride in the slide, the search would require climbing back uphill over 1,000 vertical feet while zigzagging across debris that stretched wider than the length of a football field. He started the search but did not detect a signal.

Fortunately, both skiers were lucky. The second skier was swept downhill about 700 vertical feet but was caught by a tree high in the path. Though swept into the tree, he was not injured and only partly buried. He was able to free himself and started down looking for his friend. It was not too long before they established voice contact and soon met up.

By now, it was almost dark. The pair had lost all their equipment. They faced a long walk down the avalanche path, then through deep snow to the river. At the river, they found a road that they followed to a bridge. Finally, at about 2300 hours, they stumbled upon a cabin. The weary pair let themselves in and settled in for the night. Before leaving the next morning, they left a note describing what had happened. One set out to get their vehicle. Early in the morning, a motorist picked up a lone hitchhiker headed toward the quarry road. He shared the story of their mishap with the local motorist, who then dropped him off at his vehicle. The skier retrieved his friend, and the pair set off for home.

Sunday morning dawned sunny, and Marble residents looked out their windows to a huge avalanche on Whitehouse Mountain. Morning shadows hid any evidence of tracks, but when the sun reached the upper portion of the starting zone, the tracks became visible. Residents sounded the alarm. As locals sought better vantage points to look for clues as to what happened, word of the potential spread quickly. The helpful motorist came forward and told the searchers of the morning's events; the search stopped.

COMMENTS
At least three key points come to mind when reviewing this accident and recognizing how incredibly lucky these young men were. Tackling Colorado's steep, avalanche-prone slopes in mid-winter is always a risky proposition. At Whitehouse Mountain, there had been no recent large storms, only the steady accumulations of light snow for about a month. Usually, this means less avalanche problems, but this time it contributed to a large and deep avalanche. A deep-slab avalanche surprised the pair. It was not until the two were well down the slope -- 50ish turns -- when they triggered the avalanche. There -- sheltered from the wind -- the slab was thinner and their body weights had a greater effect on the weak layers of surface hoar and faceted grains.

These young men tried or thought they were doing the right things, but they made some easy-to-make assumptions and mistakes that nearly cost them their lives. Certainly, their young ages mean little experience, but it was the deep-slab conditions that almost did them in. A second point has to do with snow pits, and in this accident, the snow pit likely gave them the final affirmative they needed before starting down the path.

Digging quick pits and testing the snow layers is a common helped used to judge unstable conditions. Too often, backcountry travelers use snow pits to judge stability. The pair did dig a pit and deemed the snow ""stable."" It's unknown how they conducted their evaluation, but inside their pit, they may not have missed anything or done anything wrong. They might have dug deep, but not deep enough, or there may not have even been a weak layer where they dug the pit. The problem may not have been how the pit was dug but rather where it was dug.

The pair dug their pit high on the slope and just below the ridgeline. Research and experience show that snow pits and stability tests performed at the top of starting zones are much less reliable than pits and tests performed lower on a slope. The tops of slopes may not be as steep and are more affected by winds. Winds prevent the formation of surface hoar and certainly mean deeper wind-drifted snow. Deeper snow typically means stronger snow or buries the weak layer under a thick slab. Thus, snow pits dug near the top of slopes often present as stronger and more stable than what really lurks lower on the slope. They were likely fooled because their snow pit was dug in a less-steep area of deep, wind-drifted snow. Recognizing and selecting a representative site for a snow pit takes a lot of experience, and even the most experienced sometimes dig in the wrong spots.

Because snow pits are a single measure, pits should never be used to say, ""GO"" or to confirm the snow is ""stable."" A snow pit result is only another piece of information and must be coupled with weather history, topography, snow structure, and shear quality. A strong-snow or stable result means uncertainty. A weak-snow or unstable result is a certain result, so snow pits can and should be used to say ""NO GO"" or ""unstable.""

The third key point to mention is that both skiers were caught in the same avalanche. It is always a mistake when more than one person is caught. Of course, it is easy to write this from the safety and comfort of an office, but the ""golden rule"" of backcountry travel in avalanche terrain is always, ""Go one person at a time."" Most buried avalanche victims found alive are found by their companions. In the backcountry, a companion is the ""rescue team,"" and when the companion is caught, partly buried, buried, injured, or killed, there is no rescue of the living. The next rescue team usually makes a recovery of the dead.

The seduction of powder is a powerful enticement to play on backcountry slopes. We must be willing to temper our enthusiasm so as not to take unnecessary risks. One way to do this is to always think of snow and steep slopes as unstable, and continually ask yourself, ""What am I missing?"" This will keep you looking for clues to dangerous conditions. If you think of snow as stable, we tend to put on blinders and seek clues that only confirm stability. This narrow vision is a recipe for disaster.

Over the years, Whitehouse Mountain and the Marble area have been the sites of several serious backcountry avalanche accidents. On February 21, 1984, three helicopter skiers were caught and two seriously injured on the west side of Whitehouse Mountain. The group was descending just south of the jeep road. Six years earlier, on January 6, 1978, two backcountry skiers were buried and killed while descending the steep south-facing terrain below the summit of Sheep Mountain.

On Sunday afternoon, a very experienced backcountry skier and a CAIC avalanche forecaster -- free skiing with friends -- was caught and buried in a medium-sized avalanche near Red Mountain Pass. Companions quickly found our forecaster with transceivers and had him uncovered in 7 minutes. He was unconscious when found, but quickly recovered and was able to return to the trailhead under his own power.

ACCIDENT
Earlier in the day, a group of 6 very experienced backcountry skiers and avalanche hands set out from Red Mountain Pass for a day of touring and skiing. The morning passed with excellent skiing in beautiful San Juan weather.

By early afternoon, the skiers found themselves on the south shoulder of Red Mountain No. 3. They dug a snowpit and did some stability tests. At this time, we do not know the exact results, but the conditions were deemed reasonable. The first skier would set a track with others to stay to the skier's left and follow one at a time.

After eight or ten turns, the slope fractured and the slab started to slide. Another group of skiers nearby watched as the slope immediately above the skier shattered like a pane of glass and swept over the skier. They reported no sound, no powder cloud, only the sound of flowing snow.

The skier's group above was out of sight because of the convex shape of the slope, but they heard the others yelling. The other nearby group yelled and yelled, but heard and saw nothing.

RESCUE
Within 30 seconds, the skier's group appeared above but had to move to the south side to safely approach the debris. Both groups combined efforts and quickly evaluated that it was safe to reach the slide. With all transceivers set to receive, they raced to the debris. Instantly, a signal was detected; within minutes, the signal was pinpointed, and the buried skier was confirmed with a probe pole.

The skier was uncovered unconscious from under 2 feet of debris after 7 minutes. He regained consciousness and was able to descend back to the cars on his own. (He did get a hand or two as he lost a ski in the slide.)

COMMENTS
We will have more details and information, along with comments to add, as this lucky skier was one of our own forecasters. He has taken some time off after the accident, so please give us some time to collect the information.

Mid-morning, three ice-climbers (all males in their early 20s) on the second pitch of First Gully were hit by an avalanche. The lead climber was knocked off the route and fell approximately 200 feet to the ground. He was buried under about 6 inches of debris, but was able to clear his face by himself. The avalanche hit the other two climbers, partially burying one and breaking all but their back-up anchor. The party had planned to climb Stairway to Heaven, but changed routes because they felt the avalanche danger on Stairway was too high. Poor visibility and unfamiliarity with the area prevented them from seeing the avalanche terrain above First Gully.

ACCIDENT
The group left Silverton around 0700, planning to climb Stairway to Heaven near Eureka. The group felt uneasy about avalanche conditions, but had not called the CAIC hotline. On the way to Eureka, they saw evidence of natural avalanches on a north aspect and knew the avalanche danger would be relatively high with the new snow. Because Stairway was exposed to a large and steep avalanche starting zone above the climb, they altered their plans to climb a route they felt would have less avalanche danger. They began climbing First Gully at 0800.

At approximately 1100, the lead climber was about 100 feet up the second pitch. Looking up, he saw the avalanche coming, and then was hit and knocked off the climb. The leader fell about 200 feet. He was buried under 6 inches of snow, but was able to quickly uncover his face. The avalanche hit the belayer and the third climber as well. The force of the snow broke all but their backup ice-screw anchor. The avalanche knocked over the belayer and buried him to his waist in a sitting position. The third climber was standing at the belay, and not buried.

About 200 feet of the gully between the base of the climb and the road was filled with debris.

RESCUE
The third climber (an Emergency Medical Technician) and belayer rappelled to the leader and uncovered him fully. An assessment indicated the leader's back was broken. The climbers stabilized the leader on a ledge they had dug in the avalanche debris and brought warm clothes from the nearby car. One climber went down to the road and flagged down a car. The group in the car contacted Search and Rescue.

Search and Rescue arrived within an hour. The belayer and third climber were down at the road, talking with the Sheriff, when another avalanche ran. Debris buried the injured leader under about 6 inches of snow again. He was able to uncover his face by himself. The debris filled about 200 feet of the gully, so it was probably similar in size to the first avalanche, but the debris was described as softer.

The two climbers participated with Search and Rescue in the evacuation of the lead climber. He was taken to the hospital. [Update: Jan. 2005. The injured climber is recovering. He suffered fractured vertebrae and ribs and is expected to make a full recovery.]

COMMENTS
Many ice climbs form low in avalanche paths, and even small avalanches can hit climbers with considerable force. The climbers knew that there would be avalanche danger on their intended route, and altered plans to climb a route they felt would be safer. They did not know, could not see, and were unable to evaluate the terrain and snowpack above the climb they chose. One climber commented that the avalanche hazard evaluation was different than if they had been backcountry skiing, where they could easily evaluate snow conditions. At the base of the climb, there was only the new snow on top of rocks, and no way to assess the snowpack above the route.
The two uninjured climbers have medical and avalanche training. Their medical training helped assess and stabilize the injured climber. They did not move him because of the spinal injury. They were lucky that the second avalanche was no larger than the first, that the injured climber was able to clear his head, and that only one of the party was caught.

It is unknown whether the avalanche was a slab or a loose snow avalanche; most likely, it was a loose snow avalanche that released naturally (or spontaneously) in the fresh snow off steep rocks or ice. Loose snow avalanches from steep terrain are common during times of heavy snowfall or high-intensity snowfall. Ice climbs can be especially dangerous during times of higher-intensity snowfall. (In Colorado, this means snowfall rates typically equal to and greater than about 1 inch per hour.) Even small loose-snow avalanches can hit with tremendous force in the narrow confines of an iced gully. (In terms of impact pressure, it is the velocity -- because the term is squared -- that is most important rather than the density of the snow.) Ice climbers should be very leery of narrow gullies during times of higher intensity snowfalls.

At about 2:00 PM Friday, a hiker -- on snowshoes -- was caught and buried in a medium-sized slab avalanche near Winfield. The avalanche accident occurred in the northwest basin of Point 13,044, a subpeak to the northwest of Browns Peak. The area is about one mile northwest of the summit of Mt. Huron, a popular 14er.

ACCIDENT
On Friday morning (4/9), three friends set out from Winfield to look at some land in the large west-facing bowl between Browns Peak and Mount Huron. The trio talked about climbing a peak on the way but decided to stay down low -- ""around treeline"" -- because of the avalanche danger. One man had checked our (CAIC) web page on Thursday and read our concern about the Front Range and Sawatch Ranges and about the potential of deeper-slab releases on the northerly aspects. Otherwise, the bulletin was favorable. On Friday, Colorado would be between storm systems, and the avalanche danger would be low with pockets of moderate. Pockets of unstable snow still existed, and triggered releases were still possible.

From Winfield, the men and their four dogs followed an old jeep road that skirted the lower portion of Lulu Gulch. At treeline, the road forked, and they turned south toward the basin above the Banker Mine. It was a perfect day for hiking. Though a few brief snow showers rolled through, on the surrounding peaks the clouds were gradually breaking and lifting. There was enough sun to make for great views, and at the same time, there were enough clouds to keep temperatures -- at treeline -- cool. Conditions on the trail made for easy travel. Several inches of new snow covered the firm, old snow. One man shuffled on skis while his two friends walked on snowshoes.
Once in the basin above the Banker Mine, their plan was to leave the jeep road at the first switchback. From there, they would contour southward on an ever-so-slightly ascending traverse to a bench along the west ridge of point 13,044. Once on the bench, very gentle terrain led to their destination.

When they left the jeep road, the lead man -- a skier -- suggested they spread well apart for the trek across the basin. The trio separated about 200 feet apart as they crossed the basin. Snow conditions remained unchanged. The skier was nearly across when he heard a ""shotgun blast"" followed by his friends' yells. He turned around and saw the ""middle"" man pointing upslope. The men hesitated for a moment as they watched the slope start to fracture so far above them. At first, one man thought it was only a ""slough"" as the avalanche was slow to start as fractures propagated hundreds of vertical feet above the men's track. But after a few seconds, the entire slope was in motion. The ""middle"" man dropped his pack and sprinted to the trees a hundred feet away; he barely made it. The ""last"" man and one dog sprinted, too; both were swept away just short of the trees.

The men wisely left equipment in a tree to mark their position and then started searching for their friend. After an hour, they decided that one would leave to get help. One man hurried back to Winfield, where he then drove down valley to a ranch and called 911. The Chaffee County Sheriff's Office received this call at 3:50 PM.

RESCUE
The Chaffee County Sheriff's Office immediately mobilized the Chaffee County Rescue Group, Lake County Search and Rescue, and the Summit County Rescue Team. At least two avalanche dogs from the Copper Mountain Ski Patrol also responded. Rescuers arrived before dark and started searching the lower debris. An initial wave of dry snow shot out of the narrow gully, but then a secondary wave of wet snow surged from the gully, and the debris split into two tongues. This lower debris was wet and very dense. The debris resembled ragged balls, and some were the size of cars. As darkness crept over the rescuers, one dog worked the lower debris, and the other dog worked the debris in the upper gully. Above the gully, a large bench -- more than three football fields in size -- was covered by debris.

Search conditions for the rescue dogs were ideal. Down low, the debris was still wet, while up high, the debris was dry. More importantly, a very gentle breeze drifted down the gully. It was dark and just as the rescue was being called for the night when the upper dog alerted. The rescue dog bolted upslope and onto the bench and dashed out of sight. By the time the handler had scrambled upslope, her dog had found the buried man. Pinned against a tree, the man was buried about 2-3 feet. Rescuers evacuated the man's body, but because of darkness and deteriorating weather, they could not continue the search for the buried dog. Several rescuers agreed to return later in the week to continue the search.

Had temperatures cooled faster on Friday evening or if the rescuers waited until Saturday, the lower debris would have frozen solid, sealing in any scent. Probe poles would have been nearly worthless as the frozen snow would have presented a nearly impenetrable surface.

COMMENTS
Several rescuers remarked how similar this avalanche was to the fatal Sawatch Range avalanche from a few weeks earlier on La Plata Peak. Triggered in the late afternoon, that shallow hard slab released from high above treeline but on a bit more westerly aspect. That avalanche initially released in dry snow and swept into and released wet snow lower on the mountain. The avalanche was very small as the slab was limited by terrain and aspect. The warm air temperatures and lots of sunshine causing a rapid warming of the slab may have played an important contribution to the avalanche release.

Unlike the La Plata Peak avalanche that released immediately around a glissading man, the Browns Peak avalanche was triggered from below. (Sometimes people refer to this as triggering from the ""compression zone."") A human-triggered release from low on the slope is a common characteristic of hard slab avalanches, though any slab -- either soft or hard -- can be triggered from high or low or even off to the side. It is interesting to note that the hard slab avalanches in the Mt. Guyot and Herman Gulch accidents were also triggered from low on the slope. (In general terms, softer slabs release closer to their trigger point; the harder the slab, the further out fractures propagate from the trigger point.)

Like the La Plata Peak avalanche, the Browns Peak avalanche was also a shallow hard slab from a similar aspect, triggered in the afternoon. However, temperatures on April 9 were colder. Unlike the La Plata Peak avalanche, which occurred in a rapidly warming snow cover, the Browns Peak avalanche occurred in cold, winter-like snow. Below the treeline and in the gully, the snow was wet. As similar or dissimilar as the two events, an important common denominator for both slides was the shallow snow cover. Immediately to the side of the avalanche -- from where the two men watched their friend disappear -- the snow cover was only 3 feet deep. This is probably about one-half of what would typically blanket the ground at this point in the season.

By the time we discovered the men's snow-covered tracks, it was too late to dig any pits. A simple ski-pole test (pushing a ski pole through the snow and feeling the change in resistance from the different layers) revealed a thick, firm layer in the middle of the pack. With a couple of sharp jabs or with steady heavy pressure, the snow would collapse, and the pole would plunge to the ground. Well-developed faceted grains of weak sugar snow were right beneath the slab. The snow conditions seemed more typical of January than April.

Shallow snow means one is much closer to the weak layer, no matter how soft or hard or warm or cold the slab. The closer one is to the weak layer, the greater the affect on disturbing the critical balance of stress and snow strength. These men, unfortunately, found what avalanche researchers call a ""superweak zone"" where the slab was poorly bonded to the weak layer. In this spot -- invisible to the trio -- the snow failed and fractures propagated outwards. The weak layer of faceted snow grains provided a structure for the fractures to spread. These fractures found other superweak zones, so the fractures continued. It took a while -- a few seconds -- but eventually the bonds holding the slab in place were overwhelmed and the entire slope avalanched.

Hard slabs are sinister beasts. Outwardly, conditions appear stable, but inside, the snow cover can look like a house built of cards but topped with a good-looking roof. Step in the wrong spot and everything can come crashing down. On Friday, the hard slab had been covered by recent new snow, making avalanche conditions more subtle. These men were trying to do the right things. They planned and paid attention to conditions; they adjusted their route, and they adjusted their actions (by spreading out and avoiding the steeper slopes). Their route was very reasonable. Though they didn't carry beacons (but beacons might not have made a difference), they were thinking ""avalanche."" We often say to dig pits to look for and test weak layers. If they had dug a pit or several pits, might they have found something that would have caused them to turn back? Probably not. A fracture line profile on the north side of the avalanche revealed a strong and stable snow cover. (This snow, of course, did not slide.) Stability tests with hard slabs can show mixed results, but digging does reveal the weak snow below.

More uncertainty regarding stability exists with hard slabs than with other snow conditions. The old-school adage still rings true today: ""Hard slabs should never be trusted."" These men did not trust the conditions, but also didn't find the conditions to be unreasonable. They took what they likely thought was a reasonable risk. Tragically, they had bad luck."

At 3:15 pm Saturday, March 20, two climbers were caught in a small avalanche on the west side of La Plata Peak (14,361 feet). Located about 6 miles southwest of the village of Twin Lakes (or 7 miles southeast of Independence Pass), La Plata Peak is the State's 5th highest 14,000-foot summit.

ACCIDENT
At 0730, three Colorado Springs men left their car for a day-long climb of La Plata's north-northwest ridge. Using snowshoes, they made good time on the frozen, firm snow. On Friday, they had called the Colorado Springs avalanche hotline; they carried probes, shovels, and other basic outdoor gear. The 4,000-foot vertical climb took longer than expected, and they reached the summit at 2 PM. This was about an hour later than when they had hoped. They spent a short time enjoying the summit views and warm weather. The trio knew they were in for a long day. They felt a shortcut down the west face by sitting glissade would greatly speed up their descent. Using their ice axes to control their speed, the men found the snow on the upper slopes to be firm and crusty and perfect for glissading. They glissaded two sections and then traversed over to another snow-filled gully. The snow surface was still crusty but just starting to become moist.

The victim, a 22-year-old man, had already descended a long way down slope when his friend started his third glissade. His friend had only gone a short distance when the snow fractured around him. He tried to self-arrest but was quickly tumbling out of control in the mass of sliding snow. A third friend, a bit further back, was not caught.
When the avalanche stopped, the survivor -- battered on his face and head -- was partly buried. In a Colorado Springs Gazette interview, he described the ride: ""It was like being thrown down a flight of stairs underwater, constantly being pushed and tumbled and turned."" He lost his pack in the slide, but was able to dig himself free and started looking for his buried friend. It took nearly 40 minutes for their third friend to descend the icy and rocky slope to the debris. The pair found ski poles, a snowshoe, and a shovel handle, but no friend. The men searched for two hours without success. Battered, weary, and faced with a lonely hike out, it took the pair nearly six hours to reach their car. The snow in the valley was wet and cohesionless, with every step they would sink to their knees or deeper, then the heavy, wet snow would pile back on top of their snowshoes.

RESCUE
On Sunday morning, the Chaffee County Sheriff's office mobilized the Chaffee County Rescue Group, Lake County Search and Rescue, and mountain rescue teams from Western State, Crested Butte, and Summit County. A Flight for Life helicopter helped to ferry rescuers to the scene.

An avalanche rescue dog from Crested Butte had numerous alerts, including an alert that directed a probe line to the right spot. The wet snow was very dense, and the surface layer had refrozen overnight. Several rescuers broke collapsible probes in the hard debris. The victim was found shortly before noon, buried 3 feet down.

COMMENTS
On Friday, one of the trio called our Colorado Springs Hotline message. The message is posted between about 6:30 to 7:00 AM. After the weather section, we started our snow and avalanche report with ""Spring conditions rule. All mountain areas will see an increased threat of wet-snow avalanches in the afternoon and evening hours."" Our danger rating as of Friday morning was ""overall LOW morning and MODERATE afternoon, because of wet-snow instability."" Triggered avalanches were possible.

The snow cover in the La Plata Peak area was very shallow. On Saturday morning, a nearby SNOTEL station that remotely measures snow-water equivalent reported only 60% of the average. At 10,000 feet, only about 1 foot of snow covered the ground, and at treeline, snow cover was only 3 feet. The entire snow cover below treeline was composed of well-developed, cohesionless depth hoar (faceted, sugar-like grains). The dry conditions and warmth were important factors in this accident. Snow depths were about half of what one would normally find in the area. In Colorado, a shallow snow cover is a weak snow cover. In shallow snow, the additional weight of a person more easily affects weak layers, and also shallow snow warms and turns wet faster.

Early Saturday morning, a light freeze created a thin but stout crust that supported the weight of the climbers while they traveled on snowshoes. With an early start and a north-facing ascent route, the climbers would have never encountered thaw conditions. (On Sunday, by midday, the north aspects were wet to treeline.) The group reached the summit later than expected and knew the snow would be turning wet. But as they descended from the summit, the snow at the highest elevations was still ""firm and crusty."" These conditions may have given the hikers false confidence and lured the men even lower.

The men were spread out -- vertically -- on their glissades. The victim was about ""400 yards"" below his friend when the second man started down. Unfortunately, the lower man probably did not realize what had happened above him. If he did, he may have already been bogged down in wet snow and could not escape.

On March 19, 1960, a climber was buried and killed in an avalanche low on the mountain after a failed attempt of the Ellingwood Ridge.

Just before noon, the season's first fatal avalanche occurred about 6 miles east-southeast of the town of Breckenridge. The victim, a 39-year-old Lakewood man, was snowmobiling with his brother and a friend when he triggered a sizable avalanche on the east side of Point 12,201. This sub-peak is the high point of Mt. Guyot's north flank. (On March 18, 2002, a close call occurred in the same general area.)

ACCIDENT
The three riders -- not a part of any commercial or guided tour -- started in Park County and rode north and over Georgia Pass into Summit County. They spent the morning riding in the Georgia Pass area. Late in the morning, the trio followed the trail past a cabin -- known by locals as the ""Avalanche Cabin"" where two other riders were staying. The trio continued onto a bench and past debris from an avalanche that likely ran on March 2.

The victim drove across undisturbed snow at the bottom of the broad slope. The second rider -- the victim's brother -- stopped below a thick stand of trees while the third member of the group remained parked on the bench. The victim turned around and started back across toward his waiting brother when the avalanche released. Only the trees kept both brothers from being caught and swept away.

After digging out the one machine, the two men went to get help. One drove back to the Avalanche Cabin, where the two other riders were hanging out. These riders had beacons, shovels, and probes. They sped to the avalanche. The other friend drove to a group of guided riders on Georgia Pass. From the top of Georgia Pass, the guide from Good Times Adventure Tours was able to radio in and report the accident.

RESCUE
The Summit County Sheriff's Office mobilized the Summit County Rescue Group and the Flight for Life helicopter. The helicopter picked up three ski patrollers and an avalanche rescue dog from the Breckenridge Ski Area and flew to the site.

While the Breckenridge avalanche dog searched, the others spot probed likely burial areas. One probe finally struck the victim's helmet, and the dog confirmed the spot. After more than 2 hours, the victim was found buried under 2 feet of snow.

Snowmobile riders are two times more likely to be buried than their machine. In most snowmobile accidents, the machine is carried further downslope than the rider, who is usually found within 20 to 40 feet of the machine. Because snowmobiles are seldom buried, the rider should try to hang on and not let go."

At about 1100 hours Sunday morning, two backcountry skiers were caught in a sizable hard slab avalanche in Herman Gulch, near Loveland Pass. One man was buried and seriously injured.

ACCIDENT
A party of 5 experienced backcountry skiers (4 men and 1 woman) equipped with transceivers and shovels followed Herman Creek trail northwest to the base of an avalanche path named Herman A. Leaving the trail, at least one member of the group heard a ""whumph"" sound, but the others did not. They climbed the west side of ""Herman A"" by switchbacking in and near the trees. They were climbing through over 3 feet of faceted sugar-like snow with various sun crusts.

Once above the trees, rather than traveling in an organized, single track, the party spread out. Two of the skiers were about 10 feet apart on a slightly lower-angled bench and were crossing the gully when the slab fractured above them. The avalanche, described as somewhat slow-moving moving swept both skiers almost to the valley floor. When it stopped, the woman was partly buried with just her head and one arm out of the snow. She was able to quickly dig herself out. She saw her friends pack about 50 feet away.

The other skier was buried with just his backpack and ski sticking out of the snow. She quickly dug out her friend, who had been buried for 4-5 minutes. He was not breathing and was suffering from obvious injuries.

In the meantime, the other 3 skiers descended to assist their friend. One started rescue breathing, and the victim responded and began breathing. One skied out to I-70 to notify rescuers.

RESCUE
The rescue was a coordinated effort by the Alpine Rescue Team, Clear Creek County Ambulance Service, the CCC Sheriff's Department, Flight for Life, and the Loveland Ski Area Ski Patrol. Rescuers and paramedics from the ambulance, ski patrol, and Alpine were flown in as a part of Flight for Life's Avalanche Deployment program.
The victim was lowered short a distance across the rugged debris and carried to the helicopter.

COMMENTS
We did not have a chance to speak with the members of the group in any sort of detail. They were experienced, well-equipped, knew the danger was rated considerable, and traveled a good route at least through the trees, but something or some things lured the group into lowering their guard the higher they climbed.

This season's snowfall in the Loveland Pass areas has been sorely lacking, resulting in a shallow and very weak snow cover on all aspects and elevations. Even southerly aspects have significant amounts of faceted, weak, depth hoar. These slopes might be even ""more"" dangerous because they also have layers of stout sun crusts that can support greater loads. When the snow does fracture, the resulting avalanche can be larger than expected. Also, with less snow than usual on the southerly aspects this season, there are many more exposed obstacles like rocks, stumps, and logs.

A party of four skied out of the area and off the backside of Arapahoe Basin on Thursday morning (3/20). That afternoon, the four left Arapahoe Basin Ski Area via a US Forest Service access gate. They headed westward into the backcountry toward Porcupine Peak to do some backcountry skiing on the US Highway 6 side of the ridge. After skiing, they planned to cross the North Fork of the Snake River, climb some 100 vertical feet to the highway, and hitchhike back to Arapahoe Basin Ski Area.

ACCIDENT
The group carried beacons and shovels, first aid kits, extra gear, etc., and had even discussed the avalanche danger. They had called the local Summit County avalanche hotline and knew the avalanche danger was High/Extreme. While they traveled toward Porcupine Peak, they observed no outward signs of imminent avalanche danger such as shooting cracks or a collapsing snowpack.

The group chose to avoid open slopes and decided to stay in the trees because of the avalanche danger. They normally skied one at a time and spotted each other on potential avalanche slopes. That was impossible in the treed area that they skied, so the group decided to ski one at a time to the creek bottom by going in 2-minute intervals. The first skier descended without incident and waited at the bottom. The second stopped somewhere uphill of the bottom. At about 1500 hours, they both heard trees snapping and saw the avalanche coming at them. The first skier turned and headed toward the creek. The second skier tried to ski to the side but saw the avalanche bearing down on him. He bent over and flipped the heelpieces loose to get rid of his skis and ""shinnied up a tree"" as the avalanche rushed under him. The avalanche did not run much farther downhill from his tree perch.

The third and fourth skiers were caught, swept through, and badly battered in the trees. Voice contact was made with the two injured friends. The lower skier continued to the highway to summon help. The treed skier dropped down, found his skis and one pole. He put his skins on and rushed up the debris. One man suffered a broken leg but managed to scoot down to his severely injured friend, who had been pushed against a tree.

RESCUE
The first rescuers, including 3 paramedics, reached the victims at about 1600 hours. The condition of the badly injured man steadily worsened during the evacuation. He was transported to the Snake River Clinic at Keystone, where doctors were unable to save him.

A medium- to large-sized avalanche buried and killed a 42-year-old Manitou Springs man at ""Upper"" Ptarmigan Lake near Cottonwood Pass. The avalanche was triggered at about 10:00 Sunday morning. At 10:48, the Chaffee County Sheriff's Office received the report of the accident. The man and his wife were riding snowmobiles at the lake by themselves while many other riders were in the Cottonwood Pass area. Around 16:00, the victim was found dead under 6 feet of debris by an avalanche rescue dog.

COMMENTS
We did not interview the victim's wife, the only witness to this avalanche, so there is still uncertainty about where her husband was when the slide released and what clues of avalanche danger were spotted or missed.

In many accidents, there are usually clues of avalanche danger present, but they are often missed or ignored. At this site, there was evidence of a sizable natural avalanche on the adjacent slope to the south. A soft slab avalanche had released on the northeast-facing slope sometime earlier in the week, perhaps Wednesday or Thursday. This is a guesstimate given recent snowfall and winds, inspection of the debris, and observation of the fracture line. The victim's route likely traveled within 50 to 75 feet of this debris.

While the above description may make the avalanche seem obvious and the rider oblivious, the untrained and unaware avalanche person could easily miss the slide. Little of the fracture line was visible, as recent strong winds and blowing snow filled back in the starting zone. The best sign was the irregular-shaped mounds of debris at the bottom of the slope. Though the winds had smoothed over the debris, it stood slightly taller compared to the smooth, flat adjacent slope.

Often in avalanche programs, instructors state the best clue to avalanche danger is a recent avalanche and then show a sharp photograph or two of a well-defined avalanche. A recent avalanche is certainly the best clue, but defining ""recent"" is tricky, and too often new snows and winds will hide or partly obscure recent avalanches. In this case, the natural avalanche occurred 3 or 4 days earlier, but that can still be thought of as ""recent"" because the weather conditions had not changed. Persistent strong winds causing blowing snow continued to contribute to the avalanche danger.

Take time to stomp around in avalanche debris and revisit debris piles to see how they change over time. This will help you learn to estimate the age of slides and to spot old and new avalanches, too.

This is the fourth Colorado avalanche death of the season, and the third in Chaffee County in just over 2 weeks.

On Sunday afternoon, a 57-year-old Denver man was buried and killed in a slab avalanche below Elkhead Pass near Mount Belford (14,197 feet) in the Sawatch Range. The man, accompanied by his son and a family friend, were on a multi-day backcountry ski tour. Their plan was to ski south from Vicksburg, ascend Missouri Gulch, cross Elkhead Pass into Missouri Basin, and follow Pine Creek out. They were very familiar with the area from summer climbing trips and had planned this trip for months.

ACCIDENT
The men were leery of descending the short, steep, leeward slopes below Elkhead Pass (between Belford and Missouri Mountain). Just below the pass, the men removed their skis and started to climb down to some rocky ribs. At about 3 pm and only 50ish feet below the pass, the snow collapsed and fractures shot out as one man approached some rocks.

A very small avalanche caught all three men and swept them down slope. The son and family friend were partly buried to their waist. It took about 10 minutes for the son to dig himself free. He hurried 15 feet upslope to his father's backpack, where his father was buried face down and not breathing. He started CPR and, after several minutes, got a pulse but had to assist his father's breathing for some time. His father did not regain consciousness.

The two men were able to get their unconscious companion into their tent, where they monitored his condition throughout the evening. Around midnight, the man died.

COMMENTS
The men carried shovels and probes but not transceivers (though transceivers would not have changed the outcome of this accident). The men were very experienced in the mountains and in winter conditions. The trio recognized the avalanche danger, were well aware of the blowing snow and the loading on the leeward slopes. They even experienced some collapsing earlier in the day. The men had a feeling of ""uncertainty"" about the slope, but were so close to rocks they chose to continue. They only wanted to descend to the flats below the pass to set up camp.

The men did not call the CAIC avalanche hotline or visit the CAIC website prior to leaving on the trip. The backcountry avalanche danger forecast issued Thursday afternoon (valid for Friday morning -- the start-day of their trip) for the C Mountains was ""below treeline, MODERATE. Triggered releases are possible. Near and above treeline, CONSIDERABLE, especially on N-SE aspects. Triggered releases are probable."" Also in the report was ""In all mountain areas, this is a weak, potentially dangerous backcountry snowpack. Extra caution is urged, and it would be wise for backcountry skiers, etc., to avoid steep terrain for several days until the surface layers have a chance to stabilize. By Saturday afternoon, the danger had slightly eased to an overall MODERATE with pockets of CONSIDERABLE on all aspects and elevations.

On Monday afternoon, a 48-year-old Ken Caryl man was buried and killed in a large hard slab avalanche on the southeast face of Point 13,294. This peak is also known in climbing circles as the Citadel and by its lesser-known name -- Snoopy (for its resemblance to the Peanuts character on his dog house) -- by those who ski Loveland Basin.

ACCIDENT
The men had parked and started their trip by following the Herman Gulch trail to the saddle east of Point 13,294 between Herman and Dry Gulches. From there, the men ascended the east ridge toward the summit of the peak. At some point below the summit, they turned back and descended a short distance down the southeast ridge. High on the ridge, they decided to traverse across the broad southeast-facing slope to gain the east ridge and retrieve some gear left earlier on the ascent. At about 3:15 pm, the pair triggered the avalanche.

RESCUE
One man took a short ride but stayed on top of the moving snow. After not spotting his friend, he used his cell phone and called 911. The victim was not equipped with avalanche rescue gear.

Rescuers from Alpine Rescue Team, Loveland Ski Patrol, and Keystone Ski Patrol responded and searched into the evening without success. The search was suspended for the night.

On Tuesday morning, rescuers returned. Trained avalanche dogs alerted in a few spots, but their efforts failed to locate the buried man. Very dense avalanche debris may have been the reason the dogs struggled to detect a strong scent. Finally, a little after 2 pm, a probe line located the deceased man under 4 to 5 feet of snow.

Notes: News reports have incorrectly identified the peak as Centennial or Sentinel. Also reported was that the men were snowshoers, but they were actually peak climbers and were not using snowshoes while high on the peak.

On the afternoon of November 15, the two Golden men were climbing a steep, rocky gully on the south side of Quandary Peak. At 14,265 feet Quandary Peak is a popular ""14er"" for winter climbers and skiers. Located at the south end of the Tenmile Range, the summit is about 6.5 miles south-southwest of Breckenridge. One man carried skis on his back; his goal was to ski from the summit while his friend hiked down. The pair started their ascent at about 10:30 AM. About 1:30 PM, they triggered a slab avalanche that swept them off their feet.

The skier tumbled for about 200 feet before somehow stopping. At some point during his short tumble, he was knocked unconscious, and thinks he lost consciousness for about two hours. When he came to there was no sign of his friend. The skier removed his skis from his pack and used them to mark his position. Suffering bumps and bruises he started down the gully. Along the way he slipped and fell gashing his knee on either his ice ax or on a rock. He continued his slow progress toward the valley. In the fading daylight he found his friend--whom had been swept down the entire gully--on the surface. This man was seriously injured and unable to move. According to newspaper accounts, the skier used extra clothes to better dress his injured friend and left him a light before striking out to get help.

The man limped his way back to the east along the valley road. After about a mile and a half he reached a home where he was able to call 911.

RESCUE
An ambulance ferried the reporting skier to the Summit County Medical Center. He was later transferred to a Denver hospital. Meanwhile, the Summit County Rescue Group responded and found the injured man on the avalanche debris. He was evacuated a short distance to the road where he was put into a sled and taken by snowmobile to the highway. At this point, the story of the man's survival is truly amazing. He was resuscitated twice, once in the ambulance and once in the helicopter. He arrived at St. Anthony Hospital in Denver with severe injuries and in severe hypothermia. Nearly a week later the man is still in the hospital, but doctors are optimistic he will make a full recovery.

COMMENTS
The steep, rocky terrain on the south side of Quandary Peak is exciting, but in the wrong conditions it is dangerous and sometimes deadly. Over the years numerous climbing accidents and even a few avalanche accidents have occurred on the rugged slopes and gullies. Three years earlier (December 21, 1999) a solo skier was killed in a gully only a few hundred yards to the west of this accident.

In regard to this year's accident, it is unknown about the men's avalanche awareness training. They were certainly pushing their luck by climbing a very steep gully so soon after storms and winds. This time they were very, very lucky.

On Monday afternoon at Aspen Highlands Ski Area, a group of three snowboarders and one skier, all in their early to mid-20s, headed out through a Forest Service Backcountry Access Gate. The young men, all Aspen locals, were headed toward Maroon Bowl. At the gate, they were approached by a former avalanche technician/ski patroller who warned the group that they would likely trigger an avalanche, and with that avalanche came a real possibility of death. The group kept going and descended toward ""Jump Rock"" located low in the starting zone.

Two of the men jumped off the rock without incident. The third man off the rock triggered the avalanche when he landed. The fractures were not instantaneous; they propagated up and across the slope, almost in slow motion (relatively speaking). The three men took off down and across the slope, headed toward the south-facing terrain on the other side of the path. Instead of the entire slab shattering like a pane of glass, the fractures started on the skier's left side of the bowl and worked their way around the bowl, like a row of falling dominoes. The pursuing avalanche nipped closely at the heels of the fleeing riders. A Hollywood movie might depict a similar action scene by having a bridge crumble at the heels of the hero as he races across. One of the men in an Aspen Times interview stated, ""I heard it coming and I took off and didn't look back."" The trio reached some trees on the south-facing side of the gully, where, fortunately, the snow did not avalanche. The torrent of snow swept within about 20 feet of the group. After the avalanche, the fourth man was gone, but fortunately, he soon answered his friends' yells. He had been swept off the rock and into some trees. He was okay. The men descended the rest of the way down.

Witnesses at the ski area, fearing the worst, alerted the ski patrol, who in turn notified the sheriff's department and Aspen Mountain Rescue. After a few minutes, four tracks were spotted leaving the avalanche, and rescuers knew the men had escaped.

COMMENTS
This accident and another accident a few days earlier outside of Ashcroft contrast sharply, highlighting the uncertainty and luck that can occur in avalanche accidents. In the accident outside Ashcroft, an experienced group trying to do all the right things was unlucky. In Maroon Bowl, this group apparently ignored the clues and advice and dodged a monstrous avalanche unscathed.

We have not yet spoken to the men involved (and hope to, soon), but they made some interesting comments that might give some insight into why they did what they did. It sounds like they were well prepared with avalanche beacons, shovels, and probes. Even one man had recently taken an avalanche course, and all were aware of the recent accidents. Was it youth that got them into trouble? Maybe and maybe not. Don't pass judgment and summarily dismiss their indiscretion to youth; they made three key mistakes that are common in many avalanche accidents that involve people who have at least some level of avalanche awareness training. They made an error in judgment caused by attitude and overconfidence. And while they may have known that the avalanche threat was considerable, they could not judge their risk.

When confronted at the gate and told about the danger and the risk they faced, they chose to continue. Perhaps this was arrogance or even an anti-authority behavior on their part, but it is well known that no one, at any age, likes to be told what to do. Maybe they were confident they could avoid trouble, or if in trouble, they could get themselves out. This confidence is common in accidents of all types. Even if you have the rescue gear and know how to use it, you must still travel as if you left your gear at home.

Their confidence--mistake two--was enhanced by an earlier experience. Earlier in the day, the four had already descended Highland Peak to Castle Creek. They rode a south-facing gully (off area) right off the summit of Highland Peak. Back to the Castle Creek road, and a parked car, they headed back to the ski area to tackle the other side of Highland Peak. Their confidence was likely buttressed by the fact that they rode Highland Peak once without problems; therefore, they could do it again. Though it was the same mountain, a different route means very different conditions.

Their third mistake, again one common in many accidents, was their failure to perceive their own risk, or what the consequences of an avalanche would mean. This can also relate directly to overconfidence and attitude. If they found trouble, they had the gear and knowledge to solve the problem. I suspect they knew the avalanche danger was significant. (We rated the danger at CONSIDERABLE.) Not only were they told, but also in The Aspen Times article, one man explained the reason why they hadn't dug any pits was ""We knew what we were going to find if we dug a pit."" This implies they knew they were venturing into the den of an avalanche dragon.

It is common in avalanche hazards (as well as other hazards) for victims to recognize the avalanche threat or potential, but for some reason, individuals fail to realize their own risk. A Utah study done in the late 1980s found that individual backcountry skiers thought someone else was two times more likely to get caught and killed in an avalanche than themselves. It's the old it can't happen to me belief. It can happen, and surviving an avalanche is luck. People who know Maroon Bowl and/or have seen the avalanche say that one would need more than luck to survive such an avalanche. These men boldly entered the avalanche dragon's den and nearly missed getting burned and consumed. We hope their close call was a good lesson learned.

One last thing to mention, in the Aspen Times article, one man attributed their mistake to the time of day and the temperature. He stated, ""...we shouldn't have gone so late. It warmed up, then it released."" It seems he missed the obvious and more important clues to avalanche danger. Though temperature can affect snow stability, in this case, temperature (and time of day, implying warmer afternoon temperatures) would be at the very bottom of the list of contributory factors. Though I wrote about the possible contribution of temperature in the accident at Crystal Peak, one must keep in mind that snow is a lousy thermal conductor. Temperatures on Monday were relatively cold, and the slope in Maroon Bowl that initially fractured faces north. The effect of temperature on this slope would be minimal at most, and even solar insolation would be slight compared to the solar radiation received on the southerly-facing slopes -- that didn't slide. In this Maroon Bowl avalanche -- like I wrote regarding the Crystal Peak accident -- there were other more important and obvious factors that contributed to the instability: a fresh slab, a steep slope, and a weak layer of faceted snow. The only missing ingredient for an avalanche was a trigger. Had they gone earlier or later, the result might have been the same, or even worse.

They made some errors in judgment that could be attributed to inexperience. Maybe it was a function of their ages, but many victims -- and much older victims -- have made the same mistakes. Gaining experience to make good judgments is a tricky thing. ""Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment.""

Here's another close call, this time in Summit County in the early afternoon on Monday, March 18, 2002. This story came to me from Sgt. Joel Cochran of the Summit County Sheriff's Department.

A group of experienced snowmobile riders (3 or 4) was high-marking at, and just above timberline on the north flank of Mt Guyot in the South Fork of the Swan River drainage. The victim, a 22-year-old man, was on his descent from a high-mark when he triggered the avalanche. At some point, he pushed away from his machine as it sank deeper and deeper in the moving snow. When the avalanche stopped, he was buried to his neck...trapped. The snowmobile was nowhere to be seen. His companions, who were out of the way of the avalanche, came to his rescue. But here's where the story gets interesting. The victim had a beacon, the only one in the group. However, the beacon was in his pack, which was attached to the snowmobile!

They eventually made contact with the Summit County Rescue Group and asked if they might help find the missing snowmobile by bringing up another beacon or two, and when found, help dig it out. SCRG politely declined.

The snowmobilers returned home to the Front Range and returned the next day with a borrowed beacon to do the search. They finally located it about 7 feet down and jammed against a tree. Sounds like it had cosmetic damage and a broken cowling, maybe more.

Needless to say, this guy was really lucky, and we hope to speak with the rider.

At about 4:30 PM, the victim's father notified the ski patrol about the missing woman. A couple of ski patrollers were sent to the gate. They quickly found her track below the snowmobile-packed road (Loushine's Road) that traverses back to the ski area. The victim's track was easy to follow as it was the only track continuing below the road. The woman continued down into a narrowing gully. As she attempted to traverse from one side of the gully to the other, she triggered a soft slab avalanche and was buried. The avalanche likely occurred before 3:00 PM. She was found under 5 feet of snow by probers at 7:15 PM.

The woman was a frequent Aspen visitor and was said to be a good skier.

Two members of the group suffered knee and ankle injuries, while another member was buried. Companions found the buried 63-year-old man under 3 feet of snow after 30 minutes. He had also been swept into a tree. Resuscitation efforts failed. The group was well-equipped and all carried rescue equipment.

The group was cautiously skiing a 22- to 24-degree slope east of the hut. They had already experienced collapsing snow and whumpfing sounds. They knew the avalanche danger was very real and serious, so they paid close attention to slope angles. One man frequently measured the slope angles. The problem was that steeper terrain (34 to 38 degrees) was directly above them.

After several runs, one member of the group moved a little higher up to dig a snow pit. He had just stopped and was getting ready to dig with the slope to the skier's right released. He had enough time to see the slide start down the slope and realize the moving snow would miss his friends. But then the slope above them released. They had triggered the avalanche from below. This is analogous to pulling a log from the bottom of a woodpile.

The soft slab avalanche occurred on a westerly-facing slope at about 11,000 feet. The avalanche was estimated to be 600 to 800 feet across and fell 300 to 400 vertical feet. The avalanche released on an old snow layer. [Early reports had the avalanche running on the ground.]

It is important to note that rescuers responding to the accident reported significant instability. They triggered a small bankslide that deposited 4 feet of snow onto the summer road. They also reported cracks shooting out from underfoot, too. It was ""really scary"" snowpack, according to rescuers."

On Saturday morning, a 29-year-old Colorado Springs man was buried and narrowly escaped death. The man was snowmobiling with his wife and relatives on Cottonwood Pass when he was caught and buried. Luck was with him that day as some other avalanche-aware and rescue-trained people were in the area.

At about 11:30, the victim followed his brother-in-law up a steep east-facing slope south of Cottonwood Pass. At this point, the story is a bit unclear, but witnesses say the victim was lower on the slope and stopped, perhaps stuck. He was off his machine in the avalanche released. The victim took off running as best he could in the deep snow, but did not get far when the avalanche plowed over him. After a few tumultuous seconds, the man found himself buried and stuck fast in the snow. In a Denver Post interview (Mar. 12, 2002, pages 1B and 3B), the man described his position, ""I could not move whatsoever. I was completely pinned down. I couldn't make a sound. I could hardly breathe."" Neither he nor his group was equipped with rescue gear.

RESCUE
After the avalanche stopped, a couple of people in the group left to get help, and one man started probing with a branch. There were others in the area who were summoned to help. At the same time, a member of the Buena Vista Search and Rescue Group was riding in the area with his son. They were part of a local snowmobile club rally and happened to ride over when they saw people on the debris. (The group from Colorado Springs was not a part of the rally.) They had a probe pole and a shovel. Shortly after, three local men rode up; they had a probe pole and several large grain-scoop shovels. They had been building a snowboarding jump. By now, the victim had been buried for about 10 minutes.

The rescue team member got out his rescue radio while his son started probing just uphill of the machine, and another man started probing below. Their only clue was the machine's ski sticking out from the snow. Within a minute, a probe hit the man buried under about 4 feet of snow. Digging uncovered a hand, then his face. He was found 6 feet uphill of the machine. Though he was not on his machine, he had not run more than a few steps when the avalanche struck.

The man was not breathing, and his color had turned ""real blue."" Another described his color as ""purple."" A sure sign that his body was not getting oxygen. The rescuers had just cleared snow from his chest and were ready to start artificial respiration when he started to breathe on his own. His color quickly returned to normal, and he slowly regained consciousness over the next five minutes. He was able to ride out on a snowmobile but spent the night in a local hospital. His only physical injury was a sore knee.

COMMENTS
This man was lucky, and he acknowledged so in the Denver Post story: ""You can't get much luckier than I did."" He was lucky that trained and equipped people were close by. He was lucky they found him so quickly, and he was lucky to have been buried in a favorable position. The man was found on his back with his face up. Victims found in this position are two times more likely to survive than those victims buried face down. When buried, a victim's body loses heat, especially around the face and head, causing the snow to melt. When buried supine with the face up, the face actually drops away from the snow, creating a small air space. If buried prone with face down, the air space is never created in front of the face as the head sinks into the snow. The fact that this man was not breathing means death was right around the corner.

This accident was typical of many snowmobile accidents. Not being equipped with avalanche rescue gear certainly put the group at a severe disadvantage, but this trait is common in most backcountry avalanche accidents, whether the victims were skiers, snowshoers, snowboarders, or snowmobilers. This accident shared several themes common to most snowmobile avalanche accidents, and sadly, similar to the fatal accident that occurred in Miner Basin a few weeks earlier (February 24, 2002). Snowmobile accidents frequently occur when more than one machine is on the slope. In both this accident and the one at Miner Basin, two riders were on this slope. In each case, the upper rider escaped, and the lower rider was buried, but don't read too much into this. These riders were lucky. The golden rule of traveling suspect slopes is ""One at a time.""

A more troubling theme is the dismissal of a significant danger clue: recent avalanches. Other avalanches had occurred along the same ridge, but the importance of their message was missed. Perhaps this was due to ignorance, arrogance, or overconfidence, or in some combination. Certainly, skiers, climbers, and snowboarders are just as guilty of this, too; however, it is common to hear of snowmobile accidents where someone in the group (and sometimes even the victim) triggered an avalanche earlier in the day or a day or two before in the same area. We hope to talk to the victim soon. I suspect that he and his companions that day had no or very little avalanche awareness training.

For all who travel in the backcountry, not getting caught in an avalanche requires avalanche education. This will overcome ignorance. Arrogance can be overcome by recognizing you can make a mistake, and overconfidence can be overcome by expecting the unexpected.

Surviving an avalanche, on the other hand, is a matter of luck. Invest in avalanche rescue gear, but travel as if you left it at home.

At about 2:45 on a sunny Wednesday afternoon, a 39-year-old Alamosa man was buried and killed in a small avalanche he likely triggered on the south side of Crystal Peak (12,777 feet), not far from the Friends Hut in the Elk Mountains of Gunnison County. The man was skiing 10 to 20 minutes ahead of some friends. No one witnessed the avalanche, but even the very quick and speedy rescue was too long in coming.

ACCIDENT
The group and the victim were a cautious bunch, concerned about avalanches. They had already been at the Friends Hut for a couple of days after skiing over from Ashcroft via a night at the Green-Wilson Hut on Sunday. They reached the Friends Hut early Monday afternoon after traversing Pearl Pass. That afternoon, several did some skiing nearby.

On Tuesday, the group skied the trees on Hunter Hill, a bit over a mile southeast of the hut and a little over a mile south of Crystal Peak. The skiing was not very good because of the shallow, weak depth-hoar snow cover. (Poor backcountry skiing because of shallow snow and depth hoar has been a common complaint voiced by backcountry skiers in most mountain areas this winter.) One member in the party described the snow conditions as ""soft - hard - soft - hard."" The snow cover and skiing were unpredictable; sometimes the snow easily supported a skier's weight, and sometimes a skier would sink to the ground in sugar snow. While skiing that day, the victim recognized and spoke about ""suspect [avalanche] slopes,"" and he and his friends carefully avoided some slopes. The victim and friends ""knew enough to be worried"" about the snow and avalanche conditions.

Tuesday night (February 5), the winds increased, causing blowing snow and temperatures to steadily warm. Wednesday morning dawned sunny and warm; it was a balmy 25 degrees at the hut. It would be a great day to climb Crystal Peak and check out the sights. Concerned about avalanche conditions, the group even practiced with their avalanche transceivers before setting out. After the practice session, four members headed off to Crystal Peak while one stayed behind to enjoy the sun.
The group reached the summit and started down the south ridge. The victim, traveling alone and in front of the others, stopped and waited for his friends. A lunch stop was called. After a short break, the victim who had been waiting the longest decided to continue down while his friends continued their lunch. Perhaps he had become a bit chilled waiting in the slight breeze.

RESCUE
After being out of sight for about 20 minutes, two men went to ""check"" on their friend. They traveled some distance before discovering the avalanche. The pair started a beacon search and quickly located the victim in about 3 minutes. The burial time was estimated at about 20 minutes, and resuscitation efforts failed. The victim was buried near the high end of the debris under about 4 feet of snow. He died from asphyxiation. Realizing their friend was dead, the men regrouped at the hut. There, they used an emergency radio to contact the Mt. Crested Butte Police Department.

The following day, rescuers from the Crested Butte Mountain Rescue Team headed to the site. On the way in, they met four of the group who were headed out. One member stayed behind at the hut to guide rescuers to the avalanche. The rescue team reached the avalanche in mid-afternoon and started the evacuation. After an arduous evacuation, the rescuers reached the trailhead early the next afternoon (Friday).

COMMENTS
This accident resulted in more questions than answers, and unfortunately, we will never know all the answers. As mentioned earlier, the group and the victim were avalanche-aware and cautious, but for some reason that Wednesday afternoon, the victim chose to cross a suspect slope. Perhaps the smooth, recently wind-drifted snow looked much more inviting than the surrounding wind-scoured snow. Unfortunately, it was the wrong place to go. The slab may have been more sensitive to triggered release than similar slabs in other aspects. This slab was likely warmer.

The blowing snow and warming temperatures the night before the accident are an interesting sequence of events. Blowing snow is a regular event at the higher elevations; however, a significant warm-up is less common, but a combination of the two is unusual. The blowing snow resulted in a fresh slab of relatively warm snow. In addition, the slope also faced southwest, receiving plenty of afternoon sunshine, even for early February. How can this be bad when generally we think of warm new snow as snow that will settle and stabilize quickly? Compared to colder snow, warmer snow makes it easier for a skier to affect weak layers buried below.

The weight of a person penetrates deeper into a warm slab than a cold slab. In other words, warm slabs allow the weight to be transferred more easily to buried weak layers. Experienced ski patrollers and avalanche forecasters know that avalanches can be triggered more easily after sun or warm air has warmed a cold slab. The process is not understood very well, but it might help explain what happened. It is important to remember when dealing with dry-snow avalanches to never base your entire stability evaluation on temperature alone. In this case, other more important factors were evident: a fresh slab, a steep slope, and a weak layer of depth hoar. To learn more about the effect of temperatures on snow, pick up a copy of Bruce Tremper's book Staying Alive in Avalanche Terrain.

We will never know why the victim was traveling alone. Friends described the victim as ""very competitive"" and physically ""very strong."" Perhaps a friendly but anonymous rivalry kept the victim inspired to stay out in front, or perhaps he just enjoyed the solitude. Regardless of the reasons, when one travels alone, there is no margin for error. Had he stayed back with his friends, the outcome might have been very different.

This unwitnessed and very tragic incident demonstrates how a series of unintended mishaps can lead to an accident, and also how a very small loose-snow avalanche can be deadly, especially for a lone person.

The victim was skiing with friends when he became separated. His friends waited at the bottom, but when he failed to arrive, they retraced their route. Failing to find their friend, they reported him missing to the ski patrol. Shortly afterward, a ski patroller spotted the victim's ski in the snow a short distance below a ski run.
Just beyond the ski area boundary rope, the man had triggered a very narrow 4 to 6-foot-wide loose-snow avalanche. He was carried a short distance down slope and buried under 18 inches of snow. The corner's preliminary report tells that the man died from asphyxiation. He was buried for about one hour.

The accident was the result of several unintended mishaps. This victim did not duck under the boundary rope and leave the ski run on purpose. The corner found the man had suffered a ""high-impact"" fall that incapacitated the victim and caused him to slide off the trail. He narrowly missed trees and landed in a very small pocket of undisturbed faceted sugar-snow. The resulting loose-snow avalanche was likely one of the smallest fatal avalanches in Colorado. The avalanche released just over 2 feet deep and to the ground, but was only a narrow ribbon of snow 4 to 6 feet wide and traveled only 130 feet (slope distance). This avalanche is classified as a L-AS-1-G.

Tragically, in this accident, a series of minor events: becoming separated from friends, falling hard, sliding off the run, and being alone, resulted in a fatal outcome. This accident demonstrates that even small avalanches can be just as deadly as large avalanches. Incapacitated from his fall, the man could not help himself. Had he still been with someone, he would have survived the avalanche. This accident also highlights a snowpack problem that affects most mountain areas at lower elevations.
This season's light snowfall has resulted in a shallow and very weak snow cover. At lower elevations (below treeline)--in many mountain areas and including the Aspen area--the snowcover is composed of depth hoar, or advanced faceted, sugar-like snow. In these areas, there is no slab or cohesive layer of snow, only sugar snow from top to bottom. This cohesionless, faceted snowcover is weak and may slough off steep slopes when pushed. Ski patrols across the state have been busy trying to strengthen this weak snow by compaction or by sloughing it off steep areas, but this snow is practically everywhere. With that said, loose-snow or point-release avalanches seldom cause serious problems. In fact, in our CAIC publication Avalanche Wise (CGS Special Publication 48), we wrote ""...they are usually small in size and seldom cause injury or damage."" Fatal loose-snow avalanches in Colorado are rare.

Prior to this accident, there had been only one other fatal avalanche accident in Colorado since 1950 involving loose snow. (One in 144 fatal avalanche accidents have involved loose snow; in five additional accidents, the type of avalanche was not known.) That accident occurred when a small cornice block fell, triggering a wet loose-snow avalanche in August of 1972, killing one hiker."

Early Wednesday afternoon, two local Boulder County men were skiing the open slope above Yankee Doodle Lake when they triggered a sizable hard-slab avalanche. The avalanche struck the ice-covered lake and shattered the ice, dumping both men into the water. The pair were skilled and avalanche-savvy backcountry skiers who were well-equipped for a day in the mountains. One man died (drowned?). His friend escaped, but unable to find his missing partner, he hiked back to the Eldora ski area to get help.

This was the men's third day in a row on this slope, where two days earlier they had enjoyed terrific powder skiing. Before starting their descent, the pair dug a snow pit. Apparently satisfied with what they had found, they agreed to ski short distances one at a time, taking turns watching each other while the other would wait at a ""safe"" spot. The first man (survivor) skied a short distance to a flatter, bench area and traversed toward some rocks to avoid a much steeper cliff area. He glanced back over his shoulder and spotted his friend who had just started down. He then realized the entire slope was moving. The avalanche left both men in Yankee Doodle Lake.

The survivor ended up nearly in the middle of the lake, approximately 190 feet from shore. Packed in shattered ice and water, he struggled to the shore. Yells for his friend brought no response, and he could not detect a signal from his friend's avalanche beacon. His waterlogged cell phone did not work, so he set out for help. He hiked down the Jenny Creek trail for the 5 miles to Eldora Mountain Resort.

RESCUE
The Eldora Ski Patrol responded first, followed by members of the Rocky Mountain Rescue Group. Arriving as darkness fell, the hasty search was organized. Searchers tried to detect a beacon signal but could not, so probe poles were used to search likely burial areas. More rescuers arrived, including avalanche rescue dogs. The rescuers could not search the shattered ice and water until later that evening when trained dive-rescuers arrived with specialized rubber suits. After 2300 hours that evening, a dive-rescue team member searching the refreezing surface detected a signal. The missing man was found 91 feet offshore in the frozen snow, ice, and water.

COMMENTS
These men were smart and savvy backcountry skiers who were doing things by the book, yet still got into trouble. At the time of the accident (and in the days before the accident), we were rating the backcountry avalanche danger in all mountain areas at CONSIDERABLE. Triggered avalanche releases were probable, and natural avalanches were possible on northwest through northeast to southeast-facing slopes near and above tree line. The avalanche the men triggered occurred on an east-southeast to southeast-facing slope at tree line.

Before rushing to judgment, remember that both men were backcountry and avalanche smart. They had the right equipment and knowledge to be out in the terrain, snow, and weather conditions. Boulder County Sheriff George Epp said it well in the Daily Camera newspaper (11/30/2001, page 5A) when he was quoted ""If you try to get a lesson out of this...the mountains can be dangerous no matter how prepared you are.""

This is the first Colorado avalanche death in Colorado in the 2001-2002 winter, and the second in the United States. Incidents where avalanche victims are swept into water and drowned are uncommon but not unheard of. In 1978, at Twin Lakes, California, a county snowplow and a pickup with two occupants were swept into the unfrozen Lower Twin Lake. The snowplow operator swam to shore. Twenty minutes later, a motorist stopped by the earlier avalanche climbed onto the debris, where he was caught by a second avalanche and swept into the lake. All three motorists drowned. In 1981, near Elko, Nevada, a snowmobiler was caught and swept into an ice-covered lake and drowned."

He was wearing snowshoes with his board in his backpack. Once he reached the bench at timberline, he began climbing up the main gully. Two other snowshoers (from Minnesota) were standing on the bench and filming the lone climber with their camcorder. They stopped filming when they thought he had reached the ridge, which happened to be 2 minutes before the avalanche, and they began walking away from the slope. At 11:55 am, the climber triggered a large avalanche when he was about 200 feet below the ridge, and about 40 vertical feet below the fracture line.

The avalanche came down with a large powder cloud, and debris filled the bench and flowed over the bench (which is about 400 feet across and slopes gently) into the timber. The debris overran the spot the two snowshoers had been standing on two minutes earlier and stopped a few feet short of where they were standing. Meanwhile, Dan Myer of Fort Collins was driving toward the pass and saw the avalanche. He parked and began climbing up the lower track toward the bench and avalanche debris area. He met the two snowshoers, learned someone was in the avalanche, and began a beacon search. He searched for 45 minutes without success. Someone stopped a CDOT truck, and the Jackson and Larimer County Sheriffs were notified. The avalanche was just inside the Jackson County line.

Sometime after 3 pm, rescuers saw the tip of a snowboard sticking from the snow and located the victim, who had died. He had been carried about 500 vertical feet down a sustained 37-degree slope and was buried about 1 foot deep.

Sadly, one 31-year-old man died several days later in a Denver hospital from internal injuries suffered when he was swept into a tree and rocks.

SUMMARY
A group of four young men (in their 20s) was visiting the Arapahoe Basin Ski Area when they decided to venture out of the area in pursuit of untracked powder. The men were skiing out-of-area in an area known as Marjorie's Bowl, just north-northeast of the ski area. Having already made one run in the area earlier in the afternoon, the group headed back to the bowl just before the lifts closed.

Two men had already skied down when the victim started down. The fourth skier started soon afterwards and likely triggered a shallow but sizable soft-slab avalanche. The victim heard the moving snow and tried to ski away from the moving snow, but was hit from behind and swept into a small tree and then into some rocks. The fourth skier was also swept down and injured when he collided with some rocks.

The two injured men were assisted by their friends back to the ski area. The group arrived long after the lifts had closed and everybody had gone home. While returning to Denver, the condition of the most seriously injured man (Skier 3) worsened. His friends took him to a Denver-area hospital, where he was admitted with serious internal injuries and a head injury. Skier 4 was treated for a shoulder/arm injury. Not wanting to draw attention to themselves, the men told the hospital staff that the two were injured ""playing ski football"" after colliding with a tree.

Two days later, Skier 3 died from internal injuries.

COMMENTS
This accident highlights the serious consequences faced by all skiers and riders who leave a ski area boundary. Often, those with the least amount of training and knowledge suffer the worst.

Much about this accident is still unknown, but friends and family of the deceased have told us some details.

The victim had moved from California to Colorado a few months earlier and was an avid skier. All four men were good skiers and had no (or very little) avalanche awareness training.

On the morning of the 21st, up to 6 inches of new, cold snow was reported in the Loveland Pass area. Reduction work by the ski patrols at both Arapahoe Basin and Loveland Basin Ski Areas produced minimal results, though Breckenridge did report several sizable avalanches triggered by explosives. However, conditions within a ski area are usually very dissimilar to conditions beyond the ski-area boundary, even when separated by only a 1/4-inch strand of rope. This group knew of the area's boundary ropes and closure signs.

By late afternoon on the 21st, the warming temperatures and sunshine softened the new snow, causing a loss in strength. By the group's second run on the northerly-facing slope, the snow had reached a critical point and could not support the additional weight of the skiers. In the spring (and early summer), fresh snow and sunshine can lead to short-term instability lasting from a few hours to perhaps a day. Usually, the most unstable slopes are those freshly snow-covered slopes that face northeast to east to south to west; however, by late in the day, even the northerly-facing slopes can become dangerous.

It may seem surprising that a serious avalanche accident could occur so close to a ski area and go unobserved. However, four factors contributed to this accident going unnoticed.

First, the avalanche could not be seen from the ski area, though the slide could likely have been seen from Loveland Pass. Second, the avalanche was triggered late in the day, and lengthening shadows likely masked the avalanche and debris area. A third factor was a vigorous spring storm that developed on the 22nd, burying any sign of the avalanche under a foot of new snow. Fourth and lastly, the men were able to affect their own rescue and did not want word of their trouble out.

Though their lack of knowledge and some questionable judgments contributed to this accident, the men did an excellent job to evacuate and care for their injured friends. It is doubtful that even a speedy rescue by the ski patrol would have changed the outcome of this accident. What is a bit disturbing is the reason why the men did not seek outside help or report the accident: their fear of potential prosecution and media attention. The future will bring more avalanche and mountaineering accidents, but when people are afraid to seek help because of potential prosecution, media attention, and/or the threat of being charged for rescue, only the victim will suffer.

Four skiers and two snowboarders were involved in this party. Three of these skiers (Rick, John, and Steve) had been skiing the Highlands Ridge backcountry for much of the season. Mike was a less frequent skier but was 'training' for a Haute Route trip in late March. The other 2 snowboarders (Brian and Justin) were planning on their own trip to a part of Maroon Bowl, but met up with the first 4 and decided to go along.

Aspen Highlands maintains an open boundary policy whereby any skier can access the National Forest where it abuts the opened ski area. They passed through the backcountry access point on Highland Ridge and continued to Highland Peak. The route they were planning on skiing is just south of Highland Peak on the west side of the ridge. It is a very steep line that has seldom been skied since the open boundary policy began three years ago.

The plan formulated was for each skier in turn to ski the entire path down to the main basin, where several other paths join and the pitch abruptly mellows to about 15 degrees. Justin boarded first and, after arriving in the runout, went to some trees below a south aspect pitch. Mike skied next straight down the gully but stopped before reaching the flats and stayed in the main track, visible to Justin. Able to see only Justin from the top, Rick waited to see Mike. When he did not, after some time, he assumed that he had found a safe area in some trees to the skier's left. Rick skied next, but partway down, began to break into the trees looking for Mike. He ended up crossing a slight ridge and skiing a south aspect into the basin. Brian left next and skied about 10 to 15 turns, breaking out to the skier's right where he felt he could see the whole pitch better. He took cover under a large rock band. Steve skied a few turns and broke out left to cover under another large rock outcrop.

As John began to ski, probably only 3 turns in, the others noticed him stumble, and John yelled 'avalanche'. He had triggered a slab about 1 foot deep and was riding in it. John was attempting to stay upright. After about 100 vertical feet, the slab released to the ground about 4 feet deep.

John was last seen tumbling in the flow. Brian reported that as the avalanche went by the there was the sound of rocks rolling in the avalanche, similar to rocks being tumbled in the spring runoff of a river. In the run out, Justin saw the avalanche coming and yelled to Rick and Mike. Both Rick and Justin began moving diagonally down in opposite directions to escape the flow. Rick reported that 'the sky went dark, the wind picked up, and I thought it was over'. Both were able to outrun the debris flow. Justin was the only one of the party who saw Mike hit in the track. The debris rapidly decelerated and spread after reaching the bottom of the track

RESCUE
Brian and Steve, after yelling for John, began to move down the path, which the avalanche had polished smooth. They had several large rocky areas to contend with to get to the debris. Their beacons were on receive the whole trip down.

Justin, well below the debris by this point, decided that the trip back up in snowboard boots would be too long. With no idea of who was left standing, he went for help.
After the powder cloud cleared, Rick reported dead silence, and he, too, did not know where anyone was. He re-skinned and returned to the debris pile.

The time of the avalanche was approximately 12:15. Justin reached the Maroon Creek Road and reported the avalanche to the T-Lazy-Seven guest ranch at about 12:45. They, in turn, notified the ski patrol and the sheriff's department. The patrol responded for the county sheriff with a hasty team of three people. Little information was available other than the number in the party and the size of the avalanche, and Justin was sure that the avalanche caught at least Mike. The others were only sure that John had been caught. Rick arrived on the debris at the same time as Steve and Brian. They all began picking up two signals, which confirmed that Mike was also involved. They had some trouble initially with the double signals, but eventually were able to pinpoint and, with some probing, located the first body, which they dug up. Mike's lips were white and his face was completely blue. After clearing his airway, they were able to find no signs of pulse or breathing, and in the correct triage fashion, turned his beacon off and began to search for John.

They quickly were able to pinpoint, then they probed and dug out John, who was at approximately the same elevation and within 100 feet horizontally from Mike. John had obvious signs of trauma. They could not detect any pulse and did not attempt CPR. After marking the bodies and reactivating the beacons, they skied towards Maroon Creek Road.

Virtually simultaneously with their arrival on the road (where ski patrol was waiting), the hasty team reached the debris. They did nothing more than confirm the identities, mark the locations, and take some coroner's photos. They then proceeded to Maroon Creek Road.

Mountain Rescue Aspen recovered the bodies the next day.

COMMENTS
This was a very experienced and equipped backcountry skiing group. There is likely no one more experienced in the terrain outside Highlands than Rick, John, and Steve. They had been digging snowpits all year and had begun skiing on Thanksgiving Day 1999 (with 15cm total snow at Highlands). Mike's choice of a safe area is the only error one could point out in the technique of the entire party. They all knew the risks and rewards of where they were skiing. The self-rescue technique was flawless, and all kept their composure during adversity. This accident serves to underscore the inherent danger in backcountry skiing on steep avalanche terrain in Colorado, especially on steep northwest aspect slopes.

A small avalanche buried and killed a well-known Snowmass Village man on the backside of Aspen Mountain. The victim had spent a great day skiing with his girlfriend and other friends in the Hurricane Bowl area near Little Annie Basin.

ACCIDENT
Toward the end of the afternoon, the girlfriend realized she had forgotten her backpack at the top of Aspen Mountain, a couple of miles away. The plan was for her to snowmobile back to the top of the ski area to retrieve her pack while her boyfriend skied down to the cars. They planned to rendezvous at the parking area between 1630 and 1700 hrs. He never arrived.

The victim's last run was down the upper portion of Hurricane Bowl and then ended in a terrain trap about one-half mile above the parking area. Skiing alone, he triggered a small avalanche in a narrow, steep-sided gully.

RESCUE
From the parking lot, the girlfriend and a friend snowmobiled back to the top of the slope, intending to find and follow the victim's tracks. Along the way, they met an Aspen Mountain ski patroller who was snowmobiling home from work. The three rounded up one other friend to help search and set out to find the tracks.

One man followed the victim's tracks into a narrow gully with a steep north-facing side. The tracks disappeared into avalanche debris. The other three approached from the bottom. When they realized what had happened, they instructed the victim's girlfriend to get additional help while the other three started the search. The victim's girlfriend called Pitkin County Sheriff's Office at 1745 hours.

A beacon search was unsuccessful, so the trio started probing the center of the gully. Standing three-across the trio could easily cover the narrow gully bottom. They made a strike after 20 minutes of probing.

The victim was found upside down, in an almost headstand position. His head was buried under 6 feet of snow. CPR was attempted without success. The victim's mouth and nose were plugged with snow.

By the time Mountain Rescue Aspen members arrived at the staging area, the man's body had been found and was being brought down to the parking area. By that time, it was dark and snowing moderately.

COMMENTS
The narrow gully was a classic terrain trap. The 37-year-old victim was an expert backcountry skier with at least some avalanche awareness training. This season, he had skied through the gully several times before. The route was logical for any skier or rider, especially in a dry season. It was an easy, direct run to the parking lot, and it had snow.

Snow conditions were unstable, and the victim knew that two days earlier, a skier in Little Annie Basin had been buried in an avalanche and was rescued by companions without injury. That accident occurred on terrain similar to where this fatal accident occurred. It is uncertain if the victim or the victim's friends encountered any obvious signs of instability, but for some reason (or reasons), he chose to ski into an obvious terrain trap during a time of great instability.

In hindsight, it is easy to say that better route finding, not traveling alone, and carrying avalanche rescue gear could have prevented this accident. However, the root of this accident is a more important issue: ""Why did this experienced skier let himself into a dangerous trap?"" At the time, he was not carrying avalanche rescue gear. The implication is that he was not expecting trouble.

Overconfidence and/or a lack of situational awareness are two key factors that lead to skilled people getting into trouble. This accident was a case where poor judgment overcame experience.

On the morning of December 21, a 25-year-old Broomfield man told friends he was going backcountry skiing, but he never told them where he was headed. A few days earlier, on the 19th, the victim had told his sister in Illinois he was going to climb a 14er, but again he failed to say where. Friends and co-workers reported him missing on the 23rd. On the 24th, the Broomfield Police Department issued a state-wide missing persons report. Later on Christmas Eve the Summit County Sheriffs Office on a routine patrol at the Quandary Peak trailhead parking lot located his vehicle. At 14,265 feet, Quandary Peak is a popular ""14er"" for winter climbers and skiers. Located at the south end of the Tenmile Range, the summit is about 6.5 miles SSW of Breckenridge.

RESCUE
On Christmas morning, the Summit County Rescue Group mobilized a search effort. Five avalanches had spilled off the Southeast side of Quandary Peak, but lady luck was with searchers that morning. Very early in the operation a searcher happened across a tiny torn piece of a topographic map. Moving 100 yards further upslope, he came across another small piece of a topographic map. Minutes later, they spotted the victim further upslope. They found the man buried in the avalanche debris. A leg protruded from the snow. The victim had died of massive trauma.

COMMENTS
The victim frequently traveled solo in the mountains, but in this situation, a partner would not have made any difference in the outcome of this accident. In fact, had a partner been traveling with the victim it is likely there would have been two fatalities. This accident could have only been prevented by better judgment. Better judgment to avoid all steep slopes during a time when very unstable snow conditions existed. The victim's level of avalanche training and/or whether he had heard a CAIC report is unknown. The traditional route up Quandary Peak is an easy ascent and descent. The route is very straightforward and avoids most dangerous avalanche slopes. Even during periods of significant avalanche danger, the route can be followed without problem with careful route selection. We will never know exactly where the victim was when the avalanche occurred or what he was thinking prior to the avalanche. Though this accident was not witnessed, reasonable inferences can be made about what happened.

The victim was found at the bottom of a very steep and rocky gully. This gully would have been a poor ski choice even in the best of weather and stability conditions. The route is well east of the summit and has two significant cliff bands that are seldom if ever covered by snow. With the cliff bands in the gully it is very unlikely the man was trying to ascend the gully. He likely was crossing near the steep slopes above the gully when it avalanched. It is unknown if the man summited, but we doubt he did.
While it is possible that the slope released naturally, this scenario is unlikely. A natural release would imply the victim was low on the slope. This setting would have taken the victim far off the route. Also relatively few natural releases were reported from around Summit County on the 21st and 22nd though a large cycle of natural releases did occur on the 23rd. The other four avalanches on Quandary likely ran that day. Also on the 21st and 22nd ski patrollers reported slab avalanches were easy to triggered from ski pressure. Most likely, the victim triggered his own avalanche.

Both of the victim's alpine touring ski boots were stripped from his feet. Boots only come off a victim when they are worn very loosely. Many people loosen their boots for ascending, but most people seldom ever wear loose boots for a descent. With loose boots it seems reasonable the victim was traversing across the top of the gully when he triggered the avalanche. Though this line of ascent would be off the established route, it would not be unreasonable.

The weather on the 21st was nasty with light snow and strong winds, but visibility was okay. That day above treeline ski patrollers around Summit County reported fair visibility. Occasionally, brief white-outs lasting a few seconds would obscure visibility, but landmarks along the route would have been visible and easy to follow. To avoid the wind the victim may have purposely veered off-route to travel in the sheltered lee of the ridge. This would have placed the victim on relatively steep terrain. Foot travel would have been easy on the hard snow. Much of this snow was relatively fresh and stable. It would have only been on this steep slope for a few weeks, so it had not had the time to weaken into faceted sugar-snow grains. But like a mine field, there were pockets of older snow on the same slope that had already weakened into sugar snow. When the victim unknowingly traveled across such a pocket, he triggered the hard slab and was swept down the mountain to his death.

Traveling alone in the high mountains during storms can be a very rewarding experience. It is a way to improve one's comfort level in difficult settings, but it is not a time to push one's limits. Obviously the consequences of any mistake can be severe or as they were in this case: fatal. Risk can be reduced significantly by exercising a large margin of safety. The judgment that allows us to set and operate within an appropriate margin of safety comes from experience. At times, gaining experience in the high mountains can be a risky proposition. Usually, when we make mistakes, the mountains are forgiving and retreat home with a lesson learned. In this accident, the mountains were unforgiving."

A small avalanche buried and killed a 21-year-old CSU student Tuesday afternoon near Cameron Pass in the Medicine Bow Mountains of Northern Colorado. Cameron Pass is a popular backcountry ski/riding area along SH14 about 50 miles west of Fort Collins. The victim was with two snowboarding friends when the avalanche occurred at about 1330. The victim, on telemark skis, was ""skinning up"" toward the south summit of the Diamond Peaks while his friends waited lower down on the peak. They did not see him get caught, but started to search after they saw (or heard) the avalanche. They were joined briefly by two other friends, who then left to get help. With no last seen area, the remaining pair could only dig with their snowboards in randomly selected spots. After making sure help was on the way, the other two returned to the accident site, but then left to guide additional rescuers back to the site.

RESCUE
The Larimer County Sheriff's Department was notified of the accident about one hour later. While search and rescue team members responded, several ""forest service"" (not sure if USFS or Colorado State Forest) employees searched some of the debris with probe poles. The search was postponed shortly after darkness due to poor visibility and additional wind loading.

The search resumed early Wednesday morning with four trained avalanche rescue dogs. The man's body was located about 10 minutes after the search started. He was buried very close to the surface; a hand and foot were within 6 inches of the surface.

The man was skiing alone at the time of the avalanche; however, he had been with friends but stopped to wait for some others.

Eight skiers in two groups were descending the Magnolia slide path in the Ophir valley. The victim was in a group of five, but decided to wait for the other three skiers. The four skiers in the first group continued down to pick up their shuttle vehicle. It seems the victim headed down alone and triggered the soft slab avalanche.

The four skiers now at their vehicle saw the powder cloud, but at first, thought it was only blowing snow. When they arrived at the bottom of the path they realized what had happened. They feared the worst, thinking the remaining four had been buried. The San Miguel Sheriff's Office was notified at 1250 hours.

They immediately started a beacon search and picked up only one signal. As they approached the signal they spotted a hand sticking out from the snow. They quickly uncovered the man and started cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. About this time the other skiers arrived and confirmed only one had been buried.

Members of the San Miguel County Search and Rescue and the Telluride Ski Patrol responded. The rescuers continued CPR but without success. The victim was declared dead at the scene. An autopsy is scheduled to determine if the victim died of suffocation or trauma.

A lucky backcountry skier survived a short burial at St. Mary's Glacier by the quick action of a couple of avalanche-savvy snowboarders. At about 10:30 AM, two skiers stood above the steep slopes above St. Mary's Lake. The first skier ventured onto the slope, and when he made his first turn, he triggered a shallow soft-slab avalanche. (He was probably carried over the cliff band seen in the photo.)

About 150 yards to the south of the avalanche, a couple of well-equipped snowboarders had just ridden down along the edge of the trees and were getting ready to hike back up hill for another run. Equipped with transceivers and shovels, the pair had decided not to tackle the glacier area but to ride in the less-steep terrain just south of the lake. They saw the avalanche and watched the skier disappear under the snow just before the snow quickly piled up at the base of the steep slope.

With a good last-seen-area noted, the snowboarders quickly rode down through the trees toward the lake and started a shallow traverse toward the debris. Getting to the flats at the lake, the pair ran the last few yards onto the debris. At the last seen area, they found the victim's glasses and quickly started digging.

They picked the right spot and soon hit the buried man. His face was uncovered within 5 minutes after the slide. The skier was buried face down with his head under about one foot of snow. His legs and feet were even deeper. (Looking at the hole, his feet were buried about 4 feet). The victim's friend carefully skied down the bed surface of the avalanche to help get his friend out. While the man was being dug out, the Clear County Sheriff's Office was notified, and local rescue teams responded.

Battered but okay, the man and his friend quietly retreated to their vehicle and avoided rescuers and questions. Fortunately, one of the rescuers called our office to report the accident. (Thank you!)

COMMENTS
Though no new snow had fallen in the past several days, conditions were ripe for an avalanche on this particular slope. Nature provided fair warning. The slope immediately to the north--the glacier proper--had recently avalanched; the fracture lines and debris were plainly visible. This avalanche likely released over the weekend as only a portion of the fracture line was covered by freshly drifted snow. Most of the fracture lines and old bed surface snow were obvious. This recent slide occurred on an identical slope as to elevation, aspect, and slope angle.

Certainly, a recent avalanche is the best clue of avalanche danger, but there was another clue--though an often neglected clue--of danger: a sun-warmed slope. Of course, the sun warms slopes in the springtime, but the avalanche danger increases when there is fresh/recent snow, often topping an icy melt-freeze crust, on steep, sun-exposed slopes. In Colorado, these sun-warmed slopes are more of an avalanche problem in the spring and early summer than in mid-winter. Here is why sun-warmed slopes can be avalanche-problem slopes.

Spring and early summer snowstorms can still deposit cold, winter-like snow. If this new snow falls onto an old, icy sun crust, the new snow tends not to adhere to this crust. While snow is a lousy thermal conductor, the sun's energy can quickly warm the top several inches of the new snow. This warming occurs first in the early mornings on steep east-facing slopes, and the warming on other aspects from south through west as the sun tracks across the sky. As the snow warms, the slab softens, and stresses caused by gravity between the warmer surface snow and the colder sub-surface snow increase. As these stresses approach the snow's strength, the slab becomes more unstable. When stresses are equal or exceed the strength, avalanches result, or avalanches can release even sooner when the additional stress caused by a person tips this tenuous balance. Be wary of fresh snow over old crusts on steep slopes bathed in bright sunshine, even early in the morning. The fresh snow does not need to become wet for avalanches to occur.

One last thing...this buried skier was very lucky to be rescued so quickly. He and his friend did not carry avalanche rescue equipment. Had the two avalanche-ready snowboarders not been so close by, this story may have ended tragically. It is also remarkable that he was able to walk away from this avalanche after tumbling through the rocks. He cheated death and walked away...he ought to buy a lottery ticket, soon!

From the north, snowmobilers can access the pass from Taylor Park Reservoir via Tin Cup, while from the south, access is from Pitkin.

A group of 6 Western State students (Gunnison) were using snowmobiles to access the backcountry skiing on Cumberland Pass (12,020 feet) in eastern Gunnison County. Two of the group waited at a cabin not far from the pass while the other four continued on. While towing skiers up to the pass, the snowmobile became stuck about 3/4 of the way up the slope. A skier continued up to the top while the other three worked at freeing the stuck machine. The skier skied down to his friends, and as he approached the small group, the entire slope fractured and released.

The four men raced to the trees, but only the skier reached the trees. He survived; his friends did not.

About 20 minutes after the group first split, one of the men at the cabin headed uphill and noticed the avalanche. He returned to the cabin for his friend, and both men returned to the avalanche. Once at the site, one man started to search while the other left to get help. He drove a snowmobile the 8 to 10 miles back to Pitkin and reported the avalanche at about 1415 hours.

At the accident site, one man, a skier, was found buried. He had been buried next to a tree that provided an air space. His companion and other rescuers used transceivers to locate the other three. The first rescuers from Pitkin arrived at 1445. By 1500 hours, the first victim was uncovered, and the other two were uncovered by 1515 hours. All three were buried between 3 and 5 feet deep.

This is the worst avalanche accident in Colorado since 3 backcountry skiers were buried and killed on Pearl Pass on January 10, 1988.

The men passed through a US Forest Service Gate and intended to ski down to the Castle Creek road, a popular ""last run"" (no pun intended) for many adventurous skiers and snowboarders. Once at the road, a ride can be hitched into town or tacticians can call-in-route for a waiting taxi. Earlier in the day, the victim had already skied a nearby gully a couple of times.

Near the end of the day, the victim waited at the top of the ski area for his friend. Ironically, the night before, the two had talked about skiing this particular run, called D Chute, and decided against it. The power of powder overwhelmed their sense of self-preservation. Even though they both left their avalanche transceivers and shovels at home, the two decided to go for it. Both men were very experienced backcountry skiers and had skied the route many times over the years.

After the pair left the ski area boundary, the men encountered several collapses along with shooting cracks, up to 100+ feet in both directions from their ski tracks. They chose to keep going.

The small, soft-slab avalanche occurred in a small gully at about 9,000 feet on a generally easterly aspect high above Castle Creek. Though the slope faces toward the east, shadows cast by trees along its south edge keep part of the slope in shade. The snow on this shaded portion is similar to the weak sugar snow found on north-facing slopes. Preliminary estimates by the ski patrollers who performed the recovery put the dimensions of the slide at 75 feet across and about 100 feet long. The victim's friend used his ski poles to probe. It took about an hour to find and uncover his buried friend. His efforts at resuscitation were unsuccessful.

The man skied down to the Castle Creek road and flagged down a ride into town, where he reported the accident. The following morning, the Aspen Highlands Ski Patrol retrieved the body.

An Avalanche Warning was in effect at the time of the accident, and the backcountry danger was HIGH. Both natural and human-triggered avalanches were likely, and backcountry travel was discouraged.

On Sunday afternoon at about 1300 hours, two snowshoers were caught in a shallow avalanche on the east-southeast face of Russell Peak, aka Russell Face. The couple had hiked westward from the Berthoud Pass Ski Area to the top of the chairlift and then continued westward toward the Continental Divide. At the top of the ""Face,"" the couple stopped for a break, and he removed his snowshoes and stood them up vertically in the snow. A strong gust of wind knocked his snowshoes over the edge, and he went to retrieve them. A short distance below the edge, the 28-year-old Missouri triggered a small slab avalanche and was swept over a short cliff. He suffered a broken clavicle or collarbone. The 30-year-old Denver woman walked to the edge to check on her friend. The couple yelled back and worth a few times; he alerted her that his snowshoes were lost and warned her not to come down. She likely crept just over the edge to better hear her friend when the entire face released. The slab fractured behind the woman in a relatively flat area and swept her over rocks and cliffs. She suffered serious head, neck, and pelvic injuries. She died in a Denver hospital 3 days later.

RESCUE
Rescuers from Alpine Rescue Team, Berthoud Pass Ski Patrol, and Loveland Ski Patrol participated in the rescue. Flight for Life flew the victim to St. Anthony's hospital where she died from her injuries 3 days later.

At the bottom of the slope, she stood up and started to climb back to her friend. She triggered the avalanche as she started up the slope. Her friend was some distance above and to the side was also caught. The slab avalanche swept both of them down. He was able to free himself quickly and started looking for his friend.

The survivor searched for about 30 minutes before other hikers joined the search. After about 40 plus minutes, word reached the Clear Creek County Sheriff's Office and a rescue effort started. Rescuers found the victim about two hours after the avalanche. An arm and a leg were protruding from the snow.

Searching avalanche debris is a very difficult proposition. Without avalanche rescue beacons and shovels, the search for a buried person is literally the same as the search for a needle in a haystack.

It is believed that he entered the slope from the side and undercut a steeper slope above, and triggered the avalanche. The avalanche started midway down the slope and left a lot of slab hanging above the fracture line.

No one reported the man overdue. Paragliders first noticed the avalanche on Tuesday, but it was not until Wednesday that paragliders saw the body. The avalanche occurred below the Ruthie's launch area near the top of the mountain.

The two men used snowshoes to hike westward from the summit of Berthoud Pass toward the Continental Divide. The pair was 3 to 4 turns down the slope when it fractured. The avalanche swept the victim down and buried him under about two feet of snow. His partner had his skis knocked off his feet, which likely allowed him to stay on the surface. When the avalanche stopped, he briefly searched for his buried friend, but since they carried no avalanche rescue gear, he started hiking out to the highway, where he flagged down a motorist.

The Berthoud Pass Ski Patrol responded with support from the Alpine Rescue Team and the Loveland Ski Area Ski Patrol. They found the victim quickly and started CPR, but the almost 2-hour burial was too long.

A 25-year-old backcountry snowboarder was buried and killed in a very small slab avalanche on the east side of San Bernardo Mountain in southwestern Colorado. The victim and another man (a skier) borrowed beacons and snowshoes and hiked up San Bernardo Mountain southwest of Ophir (near Lizard Head Pass) to ski and ride the chutes on the east face of the mountain. They were accompanied by a dog. Wearing snowshoes for the ascent, it took the men about 3 hours to climb up the south side of the mountain.

The men had already descended about 1,000 vertical feet in suspect snow conditions. The skier was having a difficult time. He kept breaking through the upper layers of the snowpack into the sugar snow, causing falls or causing him to get stuck. The two men separated, and the victim continued his descent while the skier untangled himself. The skier continued down and saw a small avalanche with tracks into and out of the debris. He thought the tracks belonged to his friend, so he followed the tracks. A ways down slope, he found the dog and quickly realized the tracks out of the avalanche did not belong to his friend but rather to the dog. At that point, he put his snowshoes back on and climbed upslope to find the avalanche debris had piled into an old prospect hole.

The skier used his beacon to locate his friend. He was buried in a standing position with his head about 3 feet deep. Rescue came too late. After a burial of 30 to 40 minutes, the victim had likely died from suffocation. The skier and dog left to report the accident. The next morning, rescuers recovered the body.

COMMENTS
This accident is a classic example of how even a very small avalanche can turn deadly when the debris piles into a terrain trap. The pair were thinking avalanche before they left, and had beacons (borrowed) and shovels. They apparently stopped thinking avalanche when they started up the trail. Perhaps they were too focused on their goal to ski/ride the east side of San Bernardo Mountain. That we don't know, but we do know that this accident also shows how a couple of small and seemingly innocent mistakes can lead to tragedy.

The men's first mistake unknowingly started with their ascent of the mountain. They followed the locals' standard approach to the summit that took them up a drainage far away from their descent route. The climb took them up a south-facing slope with very different snow...more stable...conditions than their east-facing descent route. Once onto the east-facing terrain, the snow conditions likely changed very quickly, especially as they descended and encountered less deep snow.

A more serious mistake occurred when the pair separated. They had already descended at least a thousand vertical feet in less-than-good skiing conditions when the victim kept going...for some reason. Once out of sight of each other, the skier did not know what had happened to his friend until later, when he found the dog. By the time he reacted, it was too late.

A more serious clue indicating they stopped thinking avalanche was the snow conditions. The skier kept breaking through into sugar snow and getting stuck in the loose snow. Sugar snow, topped with firmer snow, are two key ingredients for slab avalanches. Had they been thinking avalanche, they likely would have recognized the snow conditions meant avalanches, stuck together, and always traveled in sight of each other. Had the skier witnessed the avalanche, he likely would have dug his friend out in minutes. The outcome could have been different.

Travel in avalanche terrain means never letting your guard down. Little mistakes like different ascent and descent routes, or temporarily separating from your partners, may not seem serious; however, in terms of avalanches, the consequences of these minor actions can be deadly."

Two men were snowshoeing behind a cabin near Duck Lake, just over a mile south of Guanella Pass, when they triggered a slab avalanche. The weather was pleasant: blue skies, gusty winds, and mild temperatures. At about 1300 hours, the men were crossing beneath a short but steep slope through a small area of willows when they heard ""a thud"". The snow under their feet collapsed, and like pulling out a log from the bottom of a wood pile, released the slab avalanche from above. The men were about 15 feet apart, and the avalanche caught one but missed the other. He quickly looked for his friend, without success, so he dashed back to the cabin where they and their families were staying. The cabin was about 200 feet away.

From the cabin, the Clear Creek County Sheriff's Office was notified, and rescue teams were notified. The victim's friend and their wives quickly returned to the avalanche to look for the buried man. They knew basically where to look and started digging; unfortunately, they were off by a few feet. After about 45 minutes, the CCC Sheriff and another officer arrived. The sheriff took a ski pole and cut off the basket to fashion a probe pole. He started to show the others how to use the pole when he immediately probed the buried man. The 39-year-old California man was buried under 2 to 3 feet of snow near the toe (bottom) of the debris for nearly an hour.

He was quickly dug out, and resuscitation efforts started. A Flight for Life helicopter from Denver soon arrived, and advanced life support efforts were tried without luck.

COMMENTS
This accident occurred in the early season when the general snow cover was still very shallow and, to the untrained eye, no source of danger. Recent strong winds had stripped much snow off the surrounding mountains. However, the four fundamental requirements for a slab avalanche were present. First was the steep slope, though it was a very short slope; slope angle is more important than size. Second, there was the weak layer of sugar snow that provided a poor base for the firmer snow above. Third was the slab, a thick and cohesive layer of wind-deposited snow. At this point, the slope only needed a trigger, and tragically, that final requirement was provided when the two men snowshoed across the bottom of the slope.

This accident illustrates three important lessons for backcountry travelers. First, shallow snow can harbor avalanche danger, especially where winds have drifted snow onto steeper slopes. Second, short and small slopes are just as deadly as long, big slopes. Third, avalanches can be triggered from below, especially when weak faceted (sugar) is supporting a slab layer. It is important to know that most avalanches release from slopes of 30 to 45 degrees in steepness, and equally, it is just as important to learn that avalanches can occur when the snow fails on less-steep terrain. If the snow cover is consistent, not broken up by rocky areas, thick vegetation, or timber, the fractures can propagate along the weak layer to steeper slopes above and release the slab.

Gladstone Peak (13,913 feet) is a spectacular-looking peak located between two more famous 14er neighbors, Mt. Wilson and Wilson Peak. At about 1400 hours on Saturday afternoon, two Colorado climbers were caught by a natural wet-slab avalanche high on Gladstone Peak. The pair was traversing a snowfield about 100 feet below the summit when they triggered the avalanche. Details are still sketchy; however, it appears the pair were on a small rock ledge that crumbled beneath them, triggering a small wet-slab avalanche. One man was carried a very short distance and suffered only cuts and bruises. The other victim, a 23-year-old Castle Rock man, was carried about 150 to 200 vertical feet and partly buried. He apparently died from serious head injuries suffered during his short ride. He was not wearing a helmet.

Two other friends were on the ridge above the pair but did not see the avalanche. They only learned of the tragedy when the one slightly injured climber was able to scramble back to the ridge. Not equipped for steep snow travel, the three were unable to descend to their friend, so they left to get help. At a campground lower on the mountain, they borrowed a cellular telephone to alert the San Miguel Sheriff's Department.

A rapid response got rescuers to the victim by about 1700 hours. They then evacuated the body.

COMMENTS
Falling rock and avalanches are certainly among the dangers climbers face when tackling the rugged and rotten summits of the San Miguel Mountains. Though this group suffered bad luck, their accident was typical of many that occur in the mountains. Warm temperatures, late afternoons, rotten rock, shallow wet snow, and steep slopes are key ingredients to rockfall and avalanches. Add to this list the group's inexperience, lack of proper equipment, and poor decision-making, and you have the recipe for disaster. Sadly, these ingredients came together on Gladstone Peak. This accident is a grim reminder that even in summer, avalanches can still threaten the visitors to steep, high-elevation slopes.
This was the first [and only] Colorado avalanche fatality of the 1996-97 avalanche season (Sept. 1 to Aug. 31). It was the 20th avalanche fatality in the US this season.

SAFETY TIP
Summertime climbers and skiers should avoid shallow, wet snow even at the high elevations. Even on big snowfields, extra care is needed along the snowfield's margins where the snow is shallow. (My working definition of shallow is a snow cover less than a meter deep.) Shallow snow tends to be unstable snow both in winter (for different reasons) and summer. Shallow snow tends to be less dense or compacted, so it is also weaker. During the summer, melting further weakens the snow. In a shallow summer snow cover, the meltwater quickly saturates the snow and also quickly lubricates potential sliding layers such as rock, dirt, or grass. Often, all that is needed for the avalanche is a trigger: a climber, skier, snowboarder, cornice, or rock fall.

Fresh snow on old snow should also not be trusted for the same reasons as mentioned above. Melting will quickly weaken the new snow and the water will quickly lubricate the hard, icy, old snow below.

HISTORICAL JULY AVALANCHE ACCIDENTS
July 23, 1994, Mt. Hood, Oregon, two climbers caught buried and killed.
The last Colorado avalanche victim killed during July occurred on July 4, 1976, on Mt. Ypsilon. Though that accident was unwitnessed, the avalanche is suspected to have been caused when a portion of the cornice collapsed onto the steep snow slope the victim was climbing. The following year, on July 3, 1977, two climbers were caught and injured, also on Mt. Ypsilon, when a huge portion of cornice collapsed above them.

The worst July avalanche accident in the US occurred on July 22, 1939, on Mt. Baker (Washington) when a group of 25 college students was caught by a shallow soft-slab avalanche. Six were buried and killed.

At about 1400 hours on Tuesday, two local Aspen snowboarders left the Aspen Highlands Ski Area below the Steeplechase runs to ride to the valley floor. At about 9,000 feet, a 30-year-old rider triggered and was caught in a small WL [wet loose] slide that was only as wide as his snowboard. At first, the slide did not seem like much, but as the wet snow continued to ooze down the hill, it grew in size to about 40 feet across. The victim's partner watched his friend ""riding the white tiger"" head into relatively thick aspens.
Once the snow started to slide, the victim described the wet snow as ""quick sand"" from which he could not escape. His ride in the slide was ""like being in a cement mixer,"" especially when he was slammed through the aspens. Not only did the avalanche break trees, but it also ripped his binding from his board. With his feet free he was able to ""swim with the avalanche,"" and after a ride of about 500 feet, he was able to grab a tree with his legs as the avalanche slowed to a stop.
After the avalanche stopped, the second rider hurried down to help his injured friend. The victim was ""pretty beat-up,"" and by his own admission, he looked like ""he had been in a bar fight with a couple of cats."" The pair used their avalanche shovels as small crutches to assist the injured man's walk (about 100 feet) to the road and their car. After a painful hobble to the car, they headed to the emergency department at Aspen Valley Hospital, where the victim was admitted with multiple contusions and abrasions, a fractured rib, and a fractured lumbar vertebra (#4).

The man admits he was very lucky. When his snowboard was ripped from his boots, he gained some mobility that helped him swim with the slide, but it was his helmet and his backpack that likely saved his life. During the avalanche, he struck trees with his back and head, yet he was able to walk away from ""the white tiger."" He is expected to make a complete recovery.

COMMENTS
The pair were well-equipped and carried avalanche rescue gear, but were not expecting trouble. The victim had ridden the same line 12 to 15 times this season, and on the day before (Monday), he rode a different line, but it was similar in terms of aspect, elevation, and steepness. The victim stated they did not dig a hasty pit, but if they had, he was not sure it would have changed their decision. He added that if they had dug a pit, it would have been at the top of their route, where they encountered stable snow. The avalanche released was much lower down.

As a ""Monday morning quarterback,"" it is easy to say the two started late in the day for a relatively low elevation excursion during the first significant thaw of the season, but who of us hasn't done the same thing! Nonetheless, there were several mistakes made that he hopes others will not make. First, as any investor knows, past performance does not indicate future returns. The same must be said when dealing with avalanches. It does not matter how many times you might have skied/ridden a steep slope in the past. Past actions give no indication of today's stability; this is especially true during spring-like conditions when snow stability can change greatly over short periods. Their second error was their failure to recognize changing snow conditions. For most of us, this skill comes with time spent in the mountains, and these two riders learned plenty on Tuesday afternoon. Some days, the changing snow conditions are obvious, while on other days the changes are more subtle, but it is on these days that one must take the time and look for the changes. When obvious clues to avalanche danger are not apparent, it takes time (a long time) to experience, learn, and understand how differences in temperatures can combine with snowpack depths, vegetation ground cover, elevations, and aspects to affect the snow stability. If you are uncertain of avalanche conditions, increase your margin of safety. But even when you are certain, as this injured rider said, ""expect the unexpected."" On a bright note, this incident demonstrated the importance of keeping your backpack securely on your back, where it will give some protection. Another important piece of safety equipment worn by the victim was a helmet. A piece of safety equipment we normally tend not to think about when skiing and snowboarding, especially in avalanche terrain...but on that Tuesday afternoon, it made a difference.
