On October 15, 1983, Edward Henderson (47), Johanna Backus (45), Sherman Ackley (46), and Roger Ehret (52) set out to climb the West Ridge of Mount Thompson. Although the weather was clear, the route was covered with ice.
Rather than give up our objective, we decided to traverse to the third class, East Ridge route. Once on the route, we dropped our climbing gear, taking only one rope. Although the route was covered with snow and ice, we made a fast ascent as our time was running late.
About 30 meters from the summit, Henderson, slightly off route, slipped while scrambling fourth class rock. He fell backwards six meters, coming to rest against a dead stump. He sustained a compound fracture of the right raidus and ulna.
As we were in a precarious position, Ehret immediately tied in and set up a belay for the other party members. The victim was belayed down icy rock about 30 meters to a safer position.

On February 16, 1989, a four-man Japanese expedition flew into the Kahiltna Basecamp to begin a winter ascent of the West Buttress. The group leader, Noboru Yamada (39), was climbing Mount McKinley as part of a quest to climb the highest mountain on each of the seven continents. After two days, one of the men became ill and returned to base camp. The remaining three continued their climb and on February 20 reached the 5200-meter high camp. On this same day, an Austrian team of three (Austrian Mountain Guide Expedition) made a successful climb to the summit and returned to high camp. On the 21st, stormy weather kept both parties in camp. Weather improved somewhat on the 22nd and the Austrians left high camp and descended to 2975 meters. Weather deteriorated and extreme winds enveloped the upper portions of the mountain. These extreme winds, estimated at up to 320 Kph , continued through February 26, then moderated slightly and continued between 95 and 160 Kph thro","Experienced, Deadly, Roped, Alpine/Mountaineering, Exposure, Visibility, Severe Weather",1.0,

On February 20, 1989, a friend and I (33) made a one day trip to Joshua Tree. After leading three climbs rated 5.9 or better, I led the roof of “Hobbit Roof.” After going over cleanly, I belayed my partner through. Upon walking down the backside, I decided to do the route again, free-solo. I had done this climb many times, and had done the same three weeks previously and it was a rewarding end to a fun day of climbing.
This time, I jumped in before a climber had readied himself to lead the route. I made it over the roof and missed a hand jam and slipped out of a crack. The entire impact was taken by my right foot and I shattered my right heel. Nearby climbers ran to my assistance. My partner drove me to High Desert Medical Center. I was treated and released by my own doctor. (Source: Brad Berdoy)

On Saturday morning, March 11, 1989, Linda Hepburn (36) arrived with four companions (Art Portmore, Patrick Clark, Peter Osborne, and Mike Douglass) at the base of Trap Dike on Mount Colden. Hepburn had no ice climbing experience and apparently intended just to watch the others for a while.
Conditions in the lower part of the dike were apparently good, so Hepburn was allowed to accompany the group as far as the first waterfall. There, Portmore found the bypass to the right relatively easy, and the whole group continued on to the second and higher waterfall. Again Portmore decided to take the gully to the right as the group did not have a rope and was not prepared for any technical climbing.
Hepburn looked at the steep gully and decided that she could climb it, so she continued with the group. The group then proceeded onto the sides on the face of Colden, where there was a foot or so of snow overlain by an icy crust as a result of the previous weekend’s rain.

On March 18, 1989, Staff Sargeant Lynn Tiegdan was struck and killed by lightning on Moore’s Wall. The storm occurred just after 1400. Tiegdan was part of a group of climbers who sought shelter in what they thought was a protected area. The strike affected four climbers. At the time, Tiegdan was leaning against the rock face with a wet coil of rope looped over both shoulders. Despite an over two hour resuscitative effort, which included CPR, IV, oxygen, epinephrine, atropine sulfate and sodium bicarbonate, the victim died from electrical shock.

In early August, Lawrence “Laury” Minard (51), a Seattle native who had moved to London to edit and write for Forbes Global Magazine, collapsed and died around 12,000 feet up Mount Rainier during a guided climb.
The Pierce County Medical Examiner’s Office on Friday reported Minard died of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or ASCVD. The condition occurs as fatty plaques build up on artery walls, limiting blood circulation and placing too much strain on the heart. Mountain guides who fought for 45 minutes to revive Minard said he stopped breathing soon after his collapse and never regained consciousness.
Minard’s collapse occurred while he was climbing with a guided party up Disappointment Cleaver, an outcrop of 45-degree rock bordering Rainier’s Emmons Glacier.
Guides with Rainier Mountaineering Inc. say Minard complained he was having difficulty catching his breath and needed to rest.

On April 14, 1989, Jim Sweeney (33) and Dave Nyman (31) flew to the base of Mount Dickey to attempt climbs of the Moose’s Tooth and the Elevator Shaft, a steep ice couloir on the north side of Mount Johnson in the Ruth Gorge. They established a base camp and began rock climbing on the lower portion of the Moose’s Tooth on the “Butterfly Buttress.” On the 15th, Sweeney and Nyman continued climbing and encountered bad rock. They decided to attempt the Elevator Shaft on Mount Johnson rather than continue their climb of the Moose’s Tooth.

On the 17th, after waiting out a day of bad weather, Sweeney and Nyman skied to Mount Johnson to look at the route and check avalanche condidons. They spent the night at their base camp near Mount Dickey. On the 18th, they skied to the base of Mountjohnson with packs and sleds. They climbed above the icefall on the north side of Mountjohnson and bivied 200 meters up at the base of the wall.

On April 18, 1989, about 1030, Steven W. set out from Calgary to hike and climb in the Robertson Glacier area. That evening, his father reported that he had not returned for supper as planned. At 0320 the next morning, the father reported that he had located his son’s car just north of the Buller Mountain day-use area. A reconnaisance conducted before 0500 led to the discovery of tracks heading up snow gullies on the WSW face of Mount Buller. A search was begun at first light; a pack and the body of the climber were discovered shortly after 0600.
An examination of the gully led to the following reconstruction of the accident. Steve had climbed up snow gullies to a steep headwall at 2600 meters. He was probably climbing during the afternoon when it was quite warm, since he was found with his shirt tied to his waist. His tracks stopped in the snow gully about five meters in front of a gully in a rock face.

On April 28, 1989, the North Ireland Alaskan Expedition left for the West Buttress of Mount McKinley in order to acclimatize for the Cassin. After taking eight days to reach 4300 meters and spending three nights there, they chose to move higher for a summit bid. On May 10, while moving from 5000 to 5200 meters, Philip Holmes (40) noticed very cold hands. Arriving at the 5200 meter camp, he began cutting snow blocks and upon entering his tent noticed many of his fingers were white and completely numb. The next morning he showed the definite signs of frostbite on both the left and the right hands. He descended with partner Stelfox to the Medical Camp.

On April 29, 1989, I was assigned to lead three students, Tom Del Carlo (30), Bob Dalby, and Ken Wells, up a multipitch route known as “B & D” on the east side of Wadell’s Buttress. The weather was clear, but rain the previous few days had turned the first pitch into a small waterfall. The sound of Icicle Creek made communication at any distance difficult or impossible. I led the first pitch, followed by Dalby. I climbed about one meter to the left of the normal line of ascent on a moderately angled slab that was partially dry. Protection was possible at six meters and ten meters using Friends. (The normal line has vertical cracks that take stoppers.)

I was on the second day of a planned four-day ascent of Green Butte Ridge (to include a night on top) of Mount Shasta on May 8, 1989. I was alone and about 3450 meters up.

On May 14, 1989, Henry Marsden (25) was leading a 5.10b route up a thin crack in the ’Ron and John’ cliff. The lead was protected by five wired chocks: R.P.s and taper locks. At the top, about 12 meters up, he fell. As the rope tightened, it pulled out the chocks starting from the bottom. Then finally when the top piece pulled out, there was no backup protection, and he fell to the ground, where he suffered a fractured sternum and strained back muscles. (Source: Henry Marsden, Ottawa)
Analysis
Zippering is caused by the inability of ordinary chocks that are placed for downward loading to withstand an outward pull. In principle, a remedy would be for the belayer to sit closer to the rock face, but in this case, he was already closer than two meters, and it would have been difficult to do better.

Timms had been sitting at the base of a cliff band, directly in the fall line of rappellers in her party. One of the rappellers had dislodged the rock unintentionally. Rocky Mountain National Park Rescue Team responded and evacuated Timms via long scree evac. Timms’ injuries were diagnosed at Estes Park Medical Center as a deep contusion of the right buttock.

Analysis
Positioning oneself directly beneath climbers and rappellers increases the chances of being struck by falling rock and/or equipment. Timms was not belaying anyone at the time of her accident, so it was unnecessary placing herself in that poor position. If possible, when belaying, one should be positioned off to the side of the fall line.

Deborah wanted to top rope Pink Flamingo which is easily accessed by rappelling off the ledge below. I set up the anchors for the rope.

On May 31, 1989, an experiential education program was involved in the fourth day of a five day course being conducted in southern Illinois in the Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge.
The curriculum called for rock climbing and rappelling at an area called Panthers Den, which offers an excellent site for beginning climbers and rappellers because of the height of the bluffs—roughly 10 to 15 meters. This had been a program site in the past.
After all the students had completed their climbing and rappelling, some staff expressed an interest in doing a climb. The Program Director allowed a few staff to do so, while other staff took the groups back to camp to prepare for dinner.
Rob Newcomer (27), one of the instructors, wanted to attempt a climb at the current rappel site. He wanted to rappel down without belay, and then climb back up the rock face where the rappel was set up.

On July 27, 1989, I (Ranger Scott Berhenfield) noticed that Harry Barcalow (28) and Michael Volkov (31) were overdue from their climb of the East Ridge of the Grand Teton. Ranger Randy Harrington, who signed them out to climb, told me that they appeared inexperienced and had not climbed the mountain before. Burcalow and Volkov had signed out on July 23 and were planning on returning on the 26th. The length of time they were planning to take also gave us an indication of their inexperience. During the time they were out, several significant thunder storms passed through the area, which gave us additional cause for concern. Another confusing factor was that Ranger Lanny Johnson said that when he talked to them in the Jenny Lake Ranger Station, they told him they might look at climbing the North Face of the Grand Teton. This route was in bad condition due to the weather. The prediction was for more bad weather.
For all of these reasons, I started an extensive search of bot","No/Little, Serious, Head / Brain Injury, Descent, Alpine/Mountaineering, Poor Position, Severe Weather, Off-route, Stranded / Lost / Overdue",,3.0

The rock had been dislodged by the rope of a team climbing above them. The team whose rope had dislodged the rock quickly climbed down to help. They found Rob unconscious. While bringing Walker up to their level, Rob regained consciousness. He complained of back pain and was bleeding from the mouth. It was decided that Rob may have suffered a broken back and internal injuries. Walker stayed with Rob while the other two climbers went for help. It was later determined that while Rob would have a sore head and back for a while, there were no significant injuries, but the rescue team was pretty concerned in the meantime. Rob still needed assistance to reach the summit, which was provided by CLMRG and others.

On July 31, 1989, Paul Hammond (21), Erik Larson (17), and Carl Steger (21) were traversing from rock across the ice of Lamb’s Slide to the start of Broadway Ledge. Hammond was leading the traverse with a single ax and crampons strapped to sneaker-type hiking shoes. He dodged a falling rock and fell, pulling out eight 14-inch (36 cm) wood spikes that he had placed for intermediate protection. Steger was belaying but was not anchored; he was pulled off his stance and began falling. Larson had untied himself before the accident occurred. Hammond slid 60 meters and arrested himself with his 70 cm LaPrade ice ax. Steger slid an additional 60 meters beyond Hammond and was stopped by Hammond on the 9 mm rope. The rope caught around Steger’s neck like a hangman’s noose and he sustained rope burns, in addition to pericardial tamponade and numerous lesser injuries. Hammond injured his left ankle.

On August 11,1989, about 1400, Mark D., a very experienced climber, was leading the fifth pitch of a route called Dropout on the east end of Mount Rundle. He pulled out a large block, which caused him to fall about 25 meters. His belayer held the fall. However, Mark was seriously injured, with a pelvis cracked in six places and a broken heel.

On August 13, 1989, F.E. (58) was hiking up Crowfoot Mountain. At 1100, he was ascending the small, relatively snow-free glacier on the West Face of the mountain. He stepped onto a snow bridge and fell about ten meters into a crevasse. His fall was stopped by a small snow bridge, which prevented him from landing in the water pooled at the bottom. Although uninjured, he did not have crampons, ice ax, or any other tool with which to extricate himself.

Rubio Rocabert led the first pitch of Outer Limits. The anchor at the top of the pitch—about 35 meters above the ground—consisted of two bolts side-by-side, each with a hanger and two lap (chain-repair) links. Rubio clipped a separate nonlocking carabiner to the lowest gap link of each bolt and clipped a short (38 cm) sling between the two carabiners.

The path that exists on top of the aquaduct at these points disappears and a hiker must traverse out onto the arête to rejoin the route.
Trout and Ballenger came to an arête and traversed out. The grade was perhaps 5.0. Ballenger followed, but at some point said he felt uncomfortable. Trout said he would proceed to “check it out” while Ballenger waited.
Trout completed the traverse and returned to say it was O.K. and easy the rest of the way. Ballenger said he would prefer to go an alternate route which traversed the arrete higher up. Ballenger did a rising traverse back in the direction they had come. Trout fo","Experienced, Deadly, Serious, Head / Brain Injury, Unroped , Object Dropped/Dislodged",,

Early in October, I was on the second belay ledge of a three pitch climb called “The Caverns” in Yosemite Valley’s Five Open Books area.

He removed his crampons to downclimb the first cliff and continued easily down avalanche debris toward the second, where the slope dropped away toward a narrow gully.
As Greg moved to the edge of the debris to avoid the gully by continuing his descent among the trees, he lost his footing, was unable to stop, and fell down the gully. As he collided with its rock wall on his way to the hard slope 20 meters below, his helmet and one pack strap were torn off, and one arm was badly injured. He secured his arm inside a triangular bandage and his pile jacket, and began an arduous two-hour hike to the golf course, where he caught a ride to Mineral Springs Hospital in Banff.

On April 5, 1990, around 1630, two climbers, Sean (17) and David (23), ventured off the Rock Gardens, a rock outcrop popular with the locals, and established a top rope at an existing two-bolt anchor. The rope was passed through a carabiner which allowed both the climber and the belayer to work from the bottom of the 25-meter bluff. Sometime later it was decided to move to a different location. Sean climbed to the anchor and, acting on the advice of David, removed the carabiner and threaded the rope directly through the remaining tape sling attached to the bolts. Sean was then lowered down the cliff face until the anchor sling melted through. A ten-meter fall resulted, and he sustained a severe pelvic injury.

Analysis
Snow conditions were very hard at the time of the accident. Fletcher had practiced this arrest many times the previous day, but in soft snow. With hard snow conditions, the slope might have been too aggressive for students with one day of experience. Also, there needs to be more emphasis on buying gloves and axes that allow students a good grip on the spike end of the ax.

July 25, 1990, was a warm, sunny day, as a family of four from Calgary, Alberta, stopped at the Columbia Icefields in Jasper National Park and took a walk on the Athabasca Glacier. The oldest child, Tyson (10), was lightly dressed. About 1700, he ran out ahead of his parents and disappeared; he had slipped and fallen into a tapering crack and become wedged about three meters from the surface. His father ran for assistance and located a guided walking tour on the ice. The group leader returned to the crevasse with the father, set two ice screws as an anchor, and lowered himself. Being larger than the boy, he could not descend quite as far as him, but was able to secure a rope onto one of his ankles. Returning to the surface, the guide attempted, with the father, to pull the boy out, but the pressures involved caused Tyson to scream in pain, so this method of extrication was abandoned.

A large group from the ACC General Mountaineering Camp below the Vowell Glacier were bouldering at Tamarack Glen above the north margin of the glacier on July 27, 1990, when one of them, J.D., lost her balance on a ledge, and dropped to the ground about three meters below, doing “two spectacular leaps” on the way and striking her heels three times in all. She then had difficulty walking, because of pain.
The subject’s feet were immersed in cold water to reduce swelling, and the group then helped her to get down the exposed moraine to the Vowell Glacier and about one kilometer back to the camp. She suffered a chipped metatarsal bone in her left foot.

The group leader had clearly advised everyone to stay low on the rocks and to have a “spotter” for protection.

To start the day TW rappelled to the sloping ledge just above the river at the bottom of the canyon below the route Hemateria, then proceeded to set up a belay anchor. After the anchor was set up, EO rappelled down to join TW. Next, TW proceeded to lead Stone King. This route involves a difficult traverse to a small pedestal at the base of an arete. Tom made the traverse and was about four meters up the arete when he took a leader fall. Because of the traverse, rope stretch and the fact that EO was pulled off the belay ledge, the total distance of the fall was six to seven meters. There was no problem with the protection or the belay anchor. In the process of falling, TW’s ankle struck the pedestal which resulted in a fracture.

Recently, an REI customer had an accident while rock climbing in which a carabiner broke. (He was not injured, fortunately.) The customer returned the carabiner to the Albuquerque store, and our testing lab examined the carabiner to find out what went wrong. This story explains some of the problems that were discovered—you may want to share the prevention information with your customers in the future.
The customer slipped when he came to the top of a rock pitch. When the force of his fall came on the protection a meter below, he felt only a quick jerk as a carabiner broke, and he plummeted until his next piece of protection held. Instead of a short fall, he took a heart-stopping nine meter fall. He was shaken, but fortunately not seriously injured.
Why did the carabiner break? Similar ones (the carabiner was not an REI one) had tested just fine in the REI Test Lab, a result Quality Control Engineer Cal Magnusson confirmed with further analysis after the accident. So what hap","Minor, Roped, Trad Climbing, Gear Broke",,

In early January, Lorca Rossman (19), Roman Hruska (19), and Nic Rhind (23) were turned back from their summit attempt due to high winds which were blowing rocks down from the ridges above Avalanche Gulch. They were near the 3975 meter level when they began to descend the right side of Avalanche Gulch next to the “Heart.” Seasonal snowfall below normal levels had left the ridges bare, and a constant barrage of rocks came down around us. Nic Rhind chose a steeper but less exposed route of descent to avoid the rocks. Lorca Rossman chose to glissade as rapidly as possible to below the fall-zone, to reduce his exposure time. Fifteen minutes later, Lorca and Nic met near 3350 meters, and agreed that Nic would wait for Roman Hruska, who was descending slowly in the main fall-zone, while Lorca continued down to 3000 meters to break camp. Shortly after dark, Nic and Roman arrived at camp. Roman’s balaclava was soaked with blood from a blow by a 30 cm falling rock.

In December, 1990, a climber went to solo the Cascade waterfall when his partner decided not to go with him; temperatures were around -25C. He took a rope along, but his partner had told him the descent was a walk-off, so he left it at the base. He climbed the first steep pitch but balked at the top one; this left him stranded on a ledge. After several hours he was able to attract the attention of someone below, who then went for help. Rescuers climbed up in the dark and lowered the subject, who suffered frostbite of his feet.
Analysis
With the temperature reaching -35C that night, the simple decision to leave the rope behind could have been fatal. Even in solo climbing, a rope may be essential to a safe retreat if something comes up in mid-climb. In this case, the information that the descent is a walk-off was also wrong. (Source: T.

On January 2, 1991, a three person climbing party consisting of Mark Fogarty (26), Phil Buck (26), and Binget Hanson (24) returned to Camp Muir after successfully climbing Mount Rainier via Ingraham Glacier. They planned to descend from Camp Muir on the Muir Snowfield the following day. Fogarty advised the two other members of his party that he was going to go to the western side of the snowfield to find better snow to ski on. As the party left Muir next morning in excellent weather, Fogarty intentionally separated at 1100 to begin a ski descent while the other two continued down on foot. He was not seen again by Buck and Hanson, and they reported his absence to park rangers at Paradise at 1400.

Before leaving, Barnes left a detailed message describing the route and estimated they would be overdue if not back by 1800, January 29.
When no communication had been received by that hour, friends of the climbers reported their absence to the Chelan County Sheriff, who mobilized a land and air search. High winds and an approaching storm on January 30 prohibited close inspection by helicopter or landing at the site. The flight crew could only see into Hidden Couloir, first of the three couloirs on the route, but saw no evidence of climbers.

They were walking along the corniced ridge to the summit when France broke through the overhanging cornice and fell down the vertical quartzite cliffs into a gully, a total distance of 400 meters. Jacques skied down to report the accident. The area was searched by helicopter in failing light, and two rescuers were slung in to the site. They located France’s body, but due to darkness, it was not recovered until the following morning.

On April 14, 1991, a party of six Seattle Mountaineers assembled at 0720 near the Commonwealth Basin trailhead for an “Alpine Scramble” ascent of Snoqualmie Mountain. It was raining steadily at the start with no indication the weather would improve. The group leader polled members of the party and found they wished to continue the trip. After further discussion, they had decided on the shorter, steeper Alpental route, which would get 'them higher sooner where the rain might turn to snow and shorten the trip as well by about four miles. The group also discussed safety issues and responsibilities and agreed on assignments. Robin Day (36) volunteered to serve as assistant leader. The group then began a fairly uneventful ascent, “postholing” 300 yards, whereupon three members put on snow- shoes to break trail for the others.

A local guide and Everest summiter who had turned his party around contacted Joe near Jim’s Grove and reiterated the hazards. Joe Massari continued up Lamb’s Slide, across Broadway, and onto upper Kiener’s Route. Because he was climbing solo, unroped, it can never be fully known, but evidence suggests that Massari either fell from near the top of the rock band or triggered an avalanche at this location.
Massari fell approximately 1,500 feet to Mills Glacier, where he died of massive injuries. His body was covered by deep snows.

On May 24, 1991, two male students from the University of New Hampshire (one who was to graduate the very next day) hiked into Huntington Ravine on Mount Washington to the point where the trail turns right onto rock slabs. The two students turned left and climbed about 200 feet up Central Buttress, the steep buttress between Pinnacle and Central Gullies. At that point they found that they could go neither up nor down.
They yelled to passing hikers that they needed help. The MRS was called and eight members arrived about 1700. Four rescuers in teams of two climbed up to the two students, placed anchors, put harnesses on the students, and then lowered them 200 feet to the ground. One rescuer went down with each of the two students. The rescue was completed by 1900. The students had been stuck on the cliff, each on his own very small ledge and about 30 feet apart, for five hours.

Two climbers from Colorado Springs, Jon Spangler (32) and Cathy Proenza (28), left Isput Creek on Saturday, June 1, 1991, to climb Liberty Ridge. Both were experienced rock climbers and Spangler had done some alpine climbing in Mexico. Sunday afternoon two rangers from Joshua Tree National Park, Debbie Benchley and Todd Swain, who were climbing the ridge behind them, found them at the 12,400 foot level extremely dehydrated and hypothermic. They had drunk only a quart of water between them. It seems they had belayed each other up the ridge using rock climbing techniques. They explained to Debbie that they didn’t think they could make the summit, so she decided to help them up to Liberty Cap.

On June 11, 1991, I came home from work and went out to work on my artificial climbing wall in the back yard. The wall is approximately 20 feet long by 13 feet tall. The “holds” are natural rocks that were glued on the wall with “highway reflector” cement. I’ve had the wall for three years. I used to do “laps” of traverses and ascending and descending laps. The highest difficulty on the wall would be 5.8.
I’d done a number of traverse laps and started doing the up and down laps. Along the top of the wall I’d glued some larger chickehead blocks. As I got to the top of the wall, I grabbed a large hold (six or seven pounds) with my right hand. As I pulled up, the hold broke off at the same time. My left foothold broke off too. I couldn’t recover and hang on to my left hand hold. I fell about eight feet to the pavement. I landed squarely on the heel of my right foot. I sprained my ankle and broke the right heel bone.

On June 20, 1991, Larry Sorenson (51) experienced what he believed was a recurrence of acute colitis at 14,000 feet on the West Buttress of Mount McKinley. Sorenson had also complained of gastrointestinal pain and discomfort beginning June 15. As a result of these medical conditions, Sorenson was physically unable to descend or be evacuated by his expedition members to the 7,000 foot basecamp. Sorenson was evacuated from 14,000 feet by helicopter.
Analysis
The stress of altitude, physical exertion and changes in diet appear to have been contributing factors that aggravated Mr. Sorenson‘s previous medical conditions. It is important for any individual to convey special medical conditions and restrictions to the leader of an expedition. The leader then needs to make the necessary arrangements required by that individual. It appears that there was inadequate communication between Mr. Sorenson and Mr. Bocarde regarding Sorenson‘s previous medical conditions.

The pair had ascended 3,500 feet from the bottom of the face that day. Urayama was struck with severe Acute Mountain Sickness and felt he should be rescued. That evening, the pair began calling “May Day” on their CB radio. The NPS responded with a search plane attempting to locate the “May Day” calls. Numerous contacts were made with many climbers including the Japanese, but due to a communication barrier, the two remained unidentified. “May Day” calls were again reported on June 22, and the NPS Lama helicopter began to search. Again the two Japanese were not identified. Urayama decided that he wasn’t going to be rescued, so the pair began ascending the route very rapidly, summiting early the next morning.

Nobody knows exactly why Czech, an experienced climber who had been to the top of Mount McKinley, fell here. But according to her sister, the mishap had something to do with Czech’s anchors.
Kemp said that Czech was using an advanced type of “protection,” a type that all but the most experienced of rock climbers tend to shy away from. Instead of relying on the standard top-roping technique, Czech’s anchors could be attached to the top of a cliff face by throwing them up from below.

On August 2, 1991, at 0630, Judy Swales (41) and partner Randy Moss were climbing snow on Lamb’s Slide on Longs Peak. As the pair got close to Broadway Ledge, Swales slipped on snow and fell, pulling Moss down with her. They tumbled 300 to 400 feet before Moss was able to self-arrest. Moss was unhurt but Swales sustained a fractured left wrist and sprained left ankle. Colorado Mountain School guides Jack Gorby and Steve Young, in the area, climbed up to Moss and Swales and lowered both individuals to the base of Lamb’s Slide. They then ran to Longs Peak trailhead and contacted the park service, who completed evacuation with a litter team and horseback evacuation.
Analysis
By August, the surface of Lamb’s Slide is quite hard and somewhat icy. It is an especially good idea to belay beginning climbers when conditions are like this. However, it is extremely difficult to self-arrest in the event of a fall, as illustrated by this accident.

On August 4, 1991, Paul Werner (25), Brad Berdoy (32), (Bert Daniels, 50+), and I Brian Blair (27), climbed the North Ridge of Mount Stewart. During the descent, we got to the first snowfield on the Cascadian Couloir. Even though the snowfield was steep and there were several bands of rocks below, I decided to try to glissade a short way, assuming I could stop myself if I was sliding too fast. I tried to self-arrest (using a 45 cm ice ax), and turned the wrong way—away from the head of the ax. I did not lose control of the ax, however. I had the pick in the snow and I tried to arc my body to stop myself. My pack was too heavy, and I was not able to turn all the way over. If I had turned my body the correct way to stop myself, the momentum probably would have allowed me to turn all the way over for proper self-arrest. I kept going faster and faster, and knowing I was in trouble, I shouted, “Oh no!’ I tried to position my body so my pack would absorb most of the","Serious, Descent, Unroped , Alpine/Mountaineering, Glissading, No Helmet, Fatigue",366.0,229.0

On August 4, 1991, at 1445, Kent Fortner (22) and Thomas George (20) were attempting to climb Disappointment Peak via the east couloir above Amphitheater Lake. Approximately half way up the steep snow of the couloir, George planted his ice ax and stopped to rest. His feet slid out from underneath him. In grabbing for his ice ax and attempting to self-arrest, a previously dislocated shoulder popped out. George was unable to regain control of his ice ax and started an uncontrolled slide down the couloir. He struck the rock wall edge of the couloir at least once, fell approximately 500 feet down the snow, struck the rocks at the toe of the snow and catapulted approximately 20 to 30 feet further.
Fortner and others in the area assisted George down to the lake. Fortner then ran down to report the accident, arriving at the Jenny Lake Ranger Station at 1555.

On August 4, 1991, a group of two guides and eleven students walked to an area near the center of the Coleman Glacier on Mount Baker. The ice formed an amphitheater with 30 to 50 degree walls 30 feet high which became vertical for an additional 20 feet, ending in a bulge onto an upper lip. Above the lip were clean, white ice blocks and broken ice walls with water running freely down the ice.
After a demonstration by the guides, the students paired off into five roped teams in five different locations. The students had been advised that the lead climbers should set ice screws before difficult moves; however, two students arrived at crux moves, over the lip, and chose to climb over the lip before setting a screw.
At this point, Tom Brubaker (39) had climbed onto a ledge at the top of the 30 foot skirt and already had two screws placed: one at the midpoint of the skirt, the second at the ledge.

Clarence and Lyle went hiking up toward Castle Crags on August 5, 1991. From the Plain of Six Glaciers trail, they scrambled up a large scree gully southeast of Lake Louise and then up some class-four rock, reaching the top of a pinnacle around 1500. Clarence started down, and 15 minutes later Lyle started down by a different route. Lyle went around a corner for a few seconds, heard Clarence yell, heard rockfall, and then nothing. Lyle yelled for help, and then went down to look for his friend; he found him lying approximately 100 meters below the high point in the gully.

On August 7, 1991, a party of seven wardens were at the 3050 meter level on a training climb of the Northwest Ridge of Sir Donald, accompanied by two others who had attached themselves to the group. They decided to descend because of shortage of time and party strength. Although it was mainly sunny, the sky was partly overcast and dark thunderheads had been observed to the north through most of the morning. Similarly, a lesser amount of dark cloud was seen stalled to the south. Shortly after 1300, as the third party member set up for a rappel, a small dark cloud passed over, and lightning struck the mountain face and the ridge. The person at the rappel station was slightly under a small overhang with her hands on the rock; part of the discharge passed through her shoulder and the second finger of her left hand.

On August 11, 1991, after summitting the east ridge of Mount Edith Cavell in mixed weather conditions, J.B. and J.L. had a short lunch break, and then began their descent via the west ridge.
After reaching a series of short, steep rock steps at 3293 meters, the decision was made to rappel. While down-climbing a few steps to reach the rappel station, J.B. apparentiy slipped; he tumbled past his partner and disappeared into the fog of clouds which shrouded the upper part of the mountain. The following morning his body was recovered by the Canadian Park Warden Service Search and Rescue. (Source: Canadian Parks Service, Jasper)
Analysis
The experience of the party was adequate for the objective. The primary cause of the fatality was human error and unfamiliarity with the descent, as the steep steps which they intended to rappel can be avoided completely by descending slightly to the southwest.

On August 11, 1991, Mike Morlock (16) and Rick Lago (24) had finished climbing the Rib (5.3) and started climbing Triumvirate (5.4). Mike led the first pitch to a ledge, set up an anchor system, and Rick started following. Rick got nervous and tightened up. Mike said, “No problem, I will let you back down using the rope.” When Rick reached the ground, he sat down and watched Mike pull the rope up, do some rigging and start down climbing.
Mike threaded the rope through the eye of a rusty steel angle piton that was left by a previous party. He tested the piton by putting weight on the rope. Mike put both sides of the rope through a figure 8 rappel device to use as a back up in case of a fall. He down climbed about 15 feet when he put an estimated 30% of his weight on the rope. The piton broke, Mike lost his balance and fell back an estimated 45 to 60 feet, striking several ledges and hit his head on the bottom.

On August 15, 1991, I was climbing with Lindsay Berly (26) on the East Face of Mix Up Peak in the North Cascades. As we descended, it grew dark. It was almost completely dark at 2030 when we reached what we believed to be the final rappel anchor. We only had one 50 meter rope and we weren’t sure whether it reached the bottom. Instead of rapping off into unknown vertical and overhanging terrain, we decided to traverse on the lower angle part of the face and look for a better spot to rappel. We found a horn attached to a block that appeared to be solid and close enough to the notch to get us down. Further testing of the horn wasn’t safe because it wasn’t possible to set up a back-up anchor in the surrounding rock. Lindsay clipped into the anchor and I rappelled down. The anchor held while I was on the lower angle rock, but when I stepped onto the overhang, my full weight jerked onto the anchor and it failed. The entire block pulled out.

On August 16, 1991, Wolfgang Schoch and Thorstein Hoh (18) were climbing a 45- degree snowfield in Chaos Canyon, Rocky Mountain National Park. Hoh lost his footing and slid 150 to 200 feet, struck rock, and slid another 50 feet. Hoh suffered deep lacerations to the right posterior thigh and buttocks, and was unable to walk.

On August 21, 1991, two experienced climbers—Curt Veldhuisen (29) and Gary Gray (33)—signed out at the USFS Ranger Station and proceeded to their base camp in the White Salmon drainage below Mount Shuksan. The next morning they were climbing the NW arret and stopped where the rock route meets the hanging glacier. While they were stopped to put on crampons at 1330, they noticed some small avalanche activity. Without warning, a large section of iced up glacier broke off and swept down upon the two climbers, trapped in the moat between the wall and the glacier. Curt was knocked unconscious and Gary was immediately buried in an ice fall under chunks the size of wood stoves. When Curt regained consciousness, he determined his injuries and searched for Gary.

On October 1, 1991, about 1400, Jon Thompson (22), climbing with Marty Thayer (28), had just finished climbing “Face Lift” (5.10a) and was casually rehearsing opening moves on “Beer and Loafing in Leavenworth” (5.10b) when his right foot blew off the hold after executing a high step with his left foot. He fell approximately two meters and sustained a fracture of a carpal in his right hand. The party self-evacuated to the local pub and secured ice to reduce swelling.

On October 7, 1991, Andrew H. and Janies H. climbed the east ridge of Mount Andromeda and reached the east peak at 1605. After a break, they started to descend the north bowl, at which time Andrew lost one of his crampons. They then had to move slower, and it was late in the day, so they decided to bivouac.
The following morning about 1000, Andrew tripped during the descent, and fell down the slope. James tried to hold him by self-arresting. As the rope came tight, Andrew, who was then sliding down with some speed, flew across a crevasse and against the icewall on the far side, and then fell to the bottom. At that time, the force on the rope dislodged James from his hold on the ice, and he was pulled into the same crevasse, falling on top of his partner. Andrew sustained a deep laceration to his forehead, complained of chest pains, and eventually became hypothermic. James was not injured. The following day, they were reported overdue.

On October 7, 1991, the last day of a seven-day mountaineering course, a group from the University of Calgary climbed Terminal Peak, and were descending over broken ground covered with scree and talus. One person simply “went over on the right ankle,” injuring it. He was carried downslope to their bivouac site by other party members. Four of them then hiked out to inform Park Wardens, while the remaining three stayed with the injured person.
At 0600 the next day, a helicopter was dispatched to the bivvy site. After a splint was applied to the victim’s foot, he was evacuated to Golden. He was found to have tom medial and lateral ligaments of the right ankle. (Source: Revelstoke/ Glacier National Park Warden Service)

On October 16, 1991, James Murphy (25) fell over 100 feet when his rappel anchor came loose from the tree around which it had been placed. An interview with Mike Poulin (27), Murphy’s climbing partner, revealed the following:
Poulin got down the route with the help of some other climbers. According to Poulin, they started climbing the Fine Line route at 1200. Murphy was leading and Poulin was his belayer. Murphy placed protection as he went up the first pitch. A couple times he fell and had to belayed by Poulin. The top of the first pitch was a bush about 63 feet up. Once Murphy was there, Poulin started climbing and cleaning the protection as Murphy belayed. As he climbed he had to be belayed, and there were a couple pieces of protection Poulin could not get out so he left them. Once he got to the top of the pitch, he rested.

On October 27, 1991, Niccy Code (32) was leading a group of students on Castle Rock during a semester course in mountaineering. Two of her students were finishing the second pitch of Saber (5.4) while Niccy was organizing another on Saber Ledge to bring up the last student. Once she set up the belay, Niccy untied from the rope and climbed up the second pitch of Saber. She fell about two thirds the height of the pitch, struck Saber and Loggers Ledges, and continued another 150 meters down Castle Rock. She died of massive head injuries despite having worn a helmet.

On November 9, 1991, at 1400, Dan Hepburn (26) triggered an avalanche while ascending Tyndall Glacier in Rocky Mountain National Park. Hepburn was only 40 feet from the top of the route when the entire upper glacier released, carrying him an estimated 1,000 to 1,500 feet. Hepburn was buried waist deep and positioned upright in the avalanche debris. He sustained a fractured arm. Hepburn was able to extract himself from the debris and hike out four miles to the trailhead, where he notified the park and then drove himself to the Estes Park Medical Center.
Analysis
Hepburn was fortunate in surviving this event, and should be commended for his successful efforts at self-help. Had his injuries been more severe or had he been unable to 'extract himself from the avalanche debris, the results could have been fatal, as Hepburn was climbing alone.

On November 11, 1991, Tim Reid (31) was climbing with Rachel Perch (39) when the following accident occurred:
After completing a lead I clipped off two anchor bolts and called off belay. I untied my rope and threaded it through the anchor chains. I then lowered the end to the ground, 60 feet below. I asked my belayer to anchor his end to his belay device as I would be rappelling my end to the ground. He answered okay. I put myself on rappel and advised my belayer that I was rappelling and requestioned him as to his end of the rope being anchored. He answered in the affirmative. I began to rappel and fell approximately 40 feet before my belayer stopped his end of the rope.

On January 14 at 0900, Mark Swinnerton (34) and Danny Pyatt (34) passed by rangers Kurt Oliver and Jim Detterline at the Chasm Meadows Cabin below the East Face of Longs Peak. The rangers informed the climbers that a storm was beginning, ice/snow conditions were marginal on the peak, and that overnight gear was highly recommended for winter attempts. Swinnerton and Pyatt continued on to attempt Kiener’s Route. Slowed by the marginal ice/snow conditions and caught in the storm, they traversed over to the top of the Notch Couloir and spent a brutal night without bivouac gear.

During the week of March 19-23, 1989, a ten-person Special Forces Unit of the U.S. Army climbed from Paradise to the Camp Muir area and back for the purposes of testing equipment and men in a winter mountaineering and survival environment. Three members were sent back to Paradise at 1200 on March 21 because two of them, SSGT Bronn (28) and SFC Taylor (36) , were suffering from various degrees of hypothermia, frostbite, and fatigue. SFC Martinez, a medic, was assigned to look after them. The party encountered blizzard conditions and a near white-out. Progress was very slow, with two men on skis and the third on snowshoes. For reasons unexplained, some of the equipment that would have assisted with navigation down the snowfield was given to a member of the seven-person unit continuing to Camp Muir.

During an interview with Hill, Park Service investigators found out that the group had not been properly briefed before attempting actual glissade practice. The group was also insufficiently supervised, as there were too many students per instructor. The runouts at the base of Andrews Glacier are somewhat dangerous, ending in a deep, cold alpine lake on one part and in talus on another part.

On July 6 at 1600, Ulrich Moderl (22) of Austria took a 15 meter fall from the 5.9 crux pitch of the South Ridge on Notchtop. Moderl sustained a fractured right ankle and pain in his right knee and back. Martin Pircher, Moderl’s partner, effected an evacuation and carried Moderl piggyback to the trailhead. (Source: Rocky Mountain National Park Rangers)
Analysis
Running out long alpine pitches with little or no protection increases the chance of injury in the event of a fall. Fortunately Moderl’s partner was able to perform an efficient rescue. What can never be understated in the decision for a party to perform a self-rescue is the need for a thorough medical survey. Had the pain in Moderl’s back been due to a fractured vertebrae, the three mile piggyback ride could have turned him into a paraplegic.

Around 1830 on July 15, Troy Johnson (22) met with Bill Russell. Russell stated Johnson at that particular time was intoxicated, yet expressed his desire to perform a solo over the Church Bowl. According to Russell, Johnson was climbing a route currently known as “Revised,” rated at 10(a). No ropes or protection was utilized. Approximately two to three meters up, Russell heard Johnson yell, “Oh, shit!” and then heard Johnson’s body hit the ground. When he approached Johnson on the ground to offer assistance, he observed no active respirations. He initiated artificial respirations and Johnson began to breath spontaneously. Significant amounts of hemorrhaging was observed from the back of his head. At that time Russell went for help. Johnson was taken to the clinic, and then, after stabilization, was taken to a hospital. Initial prognosis was not favorable, but he has made nearly a full recovery.

Analysis
The act of placing protection is generally the most vulnerable situation a lead climber is exposed to. It is very important for the leader to maintain a wide, stable stance and to keep three points of contact with the rock if possible. On bolt-protected leads, the climber is often tempted to stretch upwards and out of balance in an attempt to clip in before the stable stance that the bolt was drilled from is obtained. Leaders should con_x001F_centrate on getting a good stance first, and then clipping in second.

If I had a penny for every rappel I’d done, I’d be a rich man. After 22 years of climbing, my rappel odometer has rolled over a few times. And every descent of that nylon spider-line—be it at night, in rain or blizzard, at 8000 meters when you can’t think straight, on tatty 6 mm bootlace, down all kinds of rock and ice and snow, often for thousands of consecutive feet—has been uneventful. Until this summer, when percentages caught up with me...
I was alone, rappelling down the Upper Town Wall of Index, having just completed a multi-pitch, multi-day orgy of rappel bolting and moss scrubbing. At the last rappel (which I’d made a dozen times in recent weeks), I threaded the rope through the anchors, tossed the ends off, clipped a rappel device to the rope and set off. My mental checklist for any rappel includes making sure that the rope ends are ","Experienced, Descent, Roped, Sport, Ledge Fall, Fatigue, No Backup or End Knot, Rappel Error, elevation:8000m",219.0,354.0

A group of six soldiers were climbing on a cliff known as Bankhead Buttress, a few kilometers east of Banff. The leader came off while trying to place protection, and fell ten meters. One foot was badly broken, and nearly severed. Because the accident occurred fairly near to the town, the emergency response was rapid. A paramedic was slung in to the site with Park Wardens by helicopter, and the victim was then slung directly to the hospital in Banff. (Source: Banff National Park Warden Service)
Analysis
The group were climbing on uncharted rock 100 meters or so from any listed route. Where the accident happened, the rock is mostly compact limestone, so it would be difficult to find placements for protection, but that land of rock is excellent for bolting, and pioneers now often carry bolt kits, as well as the ordinary equipment, for protection.

High winds and ice-covered trails brought a January Presidential Range traverse to a sudden stop when a climber fell and broke her leg. On the second day of what would have been a three-day guided range traverse, Chris Schilig, a 47-year-old mountaineer, fell and shattered her leg at Thunderstorm Junction, a trail intersection near the summit of Mount Adams.
Members of the AMC’s Pinkham Notch Crew, the Mountain Rescue Service (MRS), and the US Department of Fish and Game responded to the emergency call of traverse leader and long-time mountaineer Bill Aughton.
Aughton, the AMC’s retail manager at Pinkham Notch Camp and a 17-year veteran of the New Hampshire mountaineering community, and an MRS member, was leading three participants of the International Mountain Climbing School’s (IMCS) trek with co-leader Dan Dougherty, when powerful, 70-mile-per-hour winds, combined with layers of ice on rock underfoot, toppled Schilig, trapping her leg in a pocket between t","No/Little, Experienced, Serious, Alpine/Mountaineering, Visibility, Severe Weather",37.0,

Since the two climbers did not hear the rock strike the cliff face, they think that it was thrown from the top of the cliff.

The belayer had not sport climbed much, and expected Spydell to belay or rappel from the top. Usually, sport climbers clip in and are lowered, so you never take them off belay.

On January 28, 1992, two ice climbers (early 20s) got to within about 50 feet of the top of Cathedral Ledge. Because of approaching darkness, they rappelled from a tree growing on the ledge just below the final chimney of Remission. When they tried to pull down their rappel ropes, the ropes moved for about 20 feet and then stuck. The climbers still had both ends of the two rope rappel. They tried for an hour and a half to free the rappel and called for help. Two MRS members went to the top of the cliff. One rappelled to free the ropes which seemed to be frozen in place. The climbers could then make another rappel to the ground.

The climbers were not carrying headlamps. With a headlamp, one of them might have been able to prusik up to free the rappel, especially since one of their two ropes was dry, having been in the pack until they started down.

at 16,200 feet on the West Buttress. During the afternoon of May 11, Mr. Sement and Mr. Berthois attempted to descend to 16,200 feet to retrieve the stove, but turned back due to winds and poor visibility. They decided to descend to 14,000 feet via the “Rescue Gully” and return to 17,000 feet that evening with a stove. Because Ms. Sement (26) felt she was too tired to descend, a decision was made to leave her at 17,000 feet. There were no other parties there.
Mr. Sement and Berthois arrived at 14,000 feet at 1430. Berthois notified NPS Moun_x001F_taineering Ranger Ron Johnson that Ms. Sement was alone at 17,000 feet without a stove, and that Mr. Sement and he were too tired to climb back to 17,000 feet.

On May 15, 1992, I was teaching an inexperienced climber the proper use of protection. I was on sandstone with few places for placing protection. I had climbed 25 feet, then put in two pieces, then told my belayer that I was falling. I then jumped off the rock face. A moment later, I heard a noise, looked behind me, and saw my protection had failed. I hit the ground, resulting in abrasions, lacerations, and a fractured leg. I was wearing a helmet, and I believe it saved my life.
Analysis
My analysis of this accident is overconfidence. I have been climbing for over 20 years, taught as a paid instructor, put up many new routes, climbed many of the hard routes in the States.

My son Erik Podenski (14) and I (42) were climbing the Northeast Buttress route on Chair Peak on May 16, 1992. This route is rated Class 4. I led all the rock pitches. We had completed the crooked chimney pitch and proceeded up the ridge to a shallow rock basin. There we ascended leftward toward a small patch of trees. The basin is generally Class 2 or 3 until the final 30+ feet below the tree pitch.
I placed a runner on the only available rock horn before starting up the last section. However, this left me approximately 60+ feet above the horn at the point where I fell.

The rescuers met two climbers at their 1800 meter base camp who were in radio contact with two stranded on the ridge. The two on the ridge claimed to have lost most of their snow protection, broken one crampon, and severely dulled their ice climbing tools in getting to where they were now. The climbing was severe enough that they felt they could neither downclimb nor continue ascending safely, but they could be reached by helicopter.

I was mountain climbing with my husband, Edward W. Enlow, Jr. (38), when he had a fatal mountaineering accident on June 13, 1992. The following is a description of the accident.
We had decided to climb Lookout Peak, a 13,661 foot mountain in the San Juan mountain range near Ophir Pass in Colorado. We had read descriptions of the climb in various books, but we did not have a topographical map of the mountain. Soon after we started to climb, we were off trail and hiking up steep, snowy slopes toward a false summit. After we reached the false summit, we looked for a route to the true summit. That route led us over an exposed ridge with loose snow and then up a steep rock couloir on the north side of the mountain. We reached the summit at 1430, much later than we had anticipated when we started the climb. Since the skies were clear and sunny, Ed wasn’t concerned about the late ascent.

Walter, Kellogg, and Coombs began climbing the lower one third of the route called the “S Couloir,” a steep snow and ice couloir interspersed with rock bands. They camped at a level area at the base of a cornice ridge line on the top of this couloir. It snowed again that night.
On the morning of the 16th, they were unable to climb due to poor weather. Late in the day the weather cleared and they began climbing the cornice ridge which marks the middle third of the route.

On June 28, 1992, at 2100, Glenn R. McDonald (31) was struck and killed by lightning near the summit of Hallett Peak after ascending Hallett Chimney II (5.6). McDonald and his partner Wayne Smart were attempting to summit when the incident occurred. Smart attempted CPR, but there was no response from McDonald.

Smart had intermediate climbing skills, but McDonald was a beginner. They did not know each other prior to the climb. They had met through a “climbing partner wanted” ad on the bulletin board of a Boulder mountaineering shop. They had initially planned to do the Culp-Bossier Route III (5.8), but could not locate the start, so did Hallett Chimney instead. They finished the technical portion of the route by about 2000. Although they noticed a prominent electrical storm in progress on nearby Longs Peak, they thought it would be safe to continue to Hallett Peak’s summit.

On July 2, 1992, a group of 15 from the Monteregie Youth Center in Chambly, including four group leaders, plus two instructors from the Quebec Mountaineering Federation (FQM), went out to a cliff on Mount Cesaire for climbing practice. First the instructors set up top ropes on five routes, and both of them checked all the anchors and knots before descending to supervise the climbing, belaying, and lowering. The youngsters climbed these routes all morning and into the early afternoon, and four of them had climbed the route “Unnamed” and been lowered safely to the bottom by 1300. Then Patrick L. took his turn, and after reaching the top, was being lowered on a pulley by a supervised belayer at the bottom when he fell some 18 meters to the ground, sustaining fractures of the right wrist, upper arm, collarbone, and shoulder.

On August 9, 1992, at 0900, Andy Griffiths (36) was attempting to climb Lamb's Slide on the East face of Longs Peak. He slipped and slid 300 feet, sustaining injuries to his left elbow, hip, and ankle. Charlie McVey reached and assessed Griffiths, and then used his portable ham radio to contact Dan St. John in Fort Collins, Colorado. St. John then reported the incident to Rocky Mountain National Park Rangers, and continued to provide the rescue team with updates from the scene until reached by the rescue team and an air ambulance helicopter.
Analysis
Mr. Griffiths’ accident is one that has been repeated continuously through the years on Lamb s Slide. Some of these slides have resulted in fatalities. Once the icy conditions of mid-summer appear on Lamb's Slide, it is almost impossible to self-arrest. To prevent a really long fall, it is not very time consumptive to set up a tandem climbing situation by roping up and moving together whil","Serious, Roped, Unroped , Solo, Alpine/Mountaineering, Belay Error",5.0,

He used some existing slings and placed other slings over rock horns so there were four placements along the ramp. At the end of the ramp he placed a small camming device and proceeded face climbing up about 10 to 12 feet. He was preparing to place another piece of protection when his toe hold failed and he yelled, “Falling.”
He feel feet first, facing the rock, striking the ramp 10 feet below, and sailed backward off into space (head down). About ten feet below the ramp, the rope pulled tight on the fifth piece of protection (the camming device) and it pulled out. The belayer felt very little pull due to rope drag. The leader then continued falling and pendulumed on the fourth piece of protection.

For Bob P. and Doug W., August 28, 1992, was day eight of a 21-day traverse of the Tahumming Horseshoe near the head of Toba Inlet. Their objective for the day was to cross a small hanging glacier, find a route down an icefall, and then cross Tahumming Glacier to reach its west flank. After two attempts to find a way down the icefall, they still faced impassable obstacles and so decided to go back up to camp on easier terrain overnight, before reconnoitering the area for alternatives the next day. They had 15 meters of rope between them, and each was carrying 18 meters of rope and a large pack. At 1600 they were ascending diagonally on steep ice with patches of snow, and numerous crevasses around them, when Bob lost his footing on the ice. He landed on his back and started to slide.

A climber (35) signed out on August 29, 1992, to do a solo climb of the north ridge of the Grand Teton. He discussed the route and his plans extensively with the rangers on duty at the Jenny Lake Ranger Station.
He failed to return as scheduled on the night of the 31st and Ranger Dorward (on routine patrol at the lower saddle) determined that his camp on the Middle Teton Glacier moraine had not been occupied that night, so a search was started on the morning of September 1.

On September 1, 1992, two Americans, Doug S. and Mike V., set out to climb the East Ridge of Mount Temple. Early fall snows had left the mountain in winter condition, but the climbers proceeded without incident until they reached the exit gullies that bypass the Black Towers. The choice of the wrong gully, and then verglas on the rock, made for challenging climbing. The climbers were on the last pitch before exiting through a cornice onto the summit ridge when Doug, the leader, ran out of protection for a belay. They agreed to move together with the protection of their immediate placements, and Mike unclipped from the lower station. While digging through the cornice, Doug dislodged a large snow block, which went down the gully and struck Mike. He fell about five meters and injured his leg before Doug stopped him.

On September 2, 1992, at 1615, Nan Derkiss (30) and John Quackenbush became stranded when they got their rope stuck on the second pitch of Pear Buttress II (5.8+) on the Book on Lumpy Ridge. Banger Scott Metcalfe and Colorado Mountain School guide Lawrence Stuempke ascended to free the Derkiss/Quackenbush rope, and then led the couple on the remainder of the four pitch route using Metcalf's ropes.
Analysis
The second pitch of Pear Buttress begins with a short traverse before a move upward into a long crack system. It is advisable to do the short traverse as a single pitch, and then do the crack system as another pitch. Many parties get hung up at this particular spot. However, any party on a multiple pitch route should be competent at self-rescue. Carrying a set of prusik loops would allow one to anchor the rope and ascend or descend to the source of trouble.

On September 12, 1992, James H. (38) and Charles B. (30) met at Moraine Lake to climb the East Ridge of Mount Temple. They set off at 1300, intending to bivouac above the Big Step and finish the climb the following day. They bivvied as planned and resumed the climb at 0800 on September 13. Early snows had encased the mountain in winter conditions, making the climbing slow and difficult, so that the climbers did not reach the summit until 0400 September 14. Due to blizzard conditions, they started down from the summit right away, but unfortunately went the wrong way, taking a rib that led them toward the north face rather than the northeast ridge, the normal descent route. They started out roped up, but soon dispensed with the rope as the traveling appeared to be straightforward. Both continued to wear their crampons over the snow and rock.

On September 15, 1992, two experienced climbers (31 and 30) started up the Snaz shortly after noon after registering for their climb that morning at the Jenny Lake Ranger Station. Since both of them had climbed together for many years and had done much longer climbs than the Snaz, it did not seem unreasonable to them to begin at such a late hour. They scrambled up the first pitch unroped and decided not to set up any anchors at the belay for the second pitch. At 1300 as one was leading, he decided to climb out and to the east. (He was about 20 feet off route at that time.) As he attempted to clip his rope into a #3 Camalot that he had placed, his right hand hold broke off and he fell.

On September 17, 1992, Robert Moore (42) was rappelling a single 7/16 inch, 820 meter rope down the face of El Capitan when he apparently lost control and slid to his death.
Moore was part of a group of about 20 people who had come and fixed ropes on both El Cap and Half Dome. Members of the group had varying goals, from rappelling and climbing both routes to just rappelling El Cap. Moore planned only to rappel El Cap.
Analysis
It appears several factors played a significant role in the accident. These include the specific mechanics of the accident, Moore's apparently casual attitude about safety, and the dynamics of the group of people who were involved with this project.
Moore, and most of the rappellers in his group, passed the top edge by “brute force.” When beginning a rappel in this manner, the full weight of the rope must be held off the edge by the rappeller. This can require considerable effort with a heavy rope. On El Cap, the rope weig","Deadly, Descent, Roped, Large Group, Stranded / Lost / Overdue, Rappel Error",,

On September 17, 1992, a report of an injured climber, Rolf Schempp (25), seven pitches up the Regular Northwest Face route of Half Dome was received by NPS dispatch. A ranger was inserted at the scene by heli-rappelling from the park contracted helicopter. When the victim was stabilized in a litter, a Navy UH-helicopter from NAS Lemoore attempted to evacuate him. However, the winds were too turbulent to attempt the hoist operation and it was aborted. A short time later the park contract helicopter was able to successfully short haul the victim from Half Dome directly to the Ahwahnee Meadow.

Around mid-day on November 26, 1992, Pat S., who was a Park Warden, Mountain Guide, and Public Safety instructor with the Canadian Parks Service in Jasper National Park, and Lisa P., a warden from Banff National Park, left their vehicle to hike in to an ice climb on the west slope of Tangle Ridge, about 100 kilometers south of Jasper. Their objective was a 50 meter sheet of ice known as “Centre Stage.” They were out for an easy recreational climb on their day off and Lisa's first attempt at waterfall ice.
After bushwhacking to reach the ice, the ascent was made routinely, and Pat lowered Lisa along the north side of the climb from a three-point anchor. Then he moved across to the south side of the ice to set up an anchor for which he used a single 30 centimeter piece of conduit. Lisa saw the ropes come down from the top, although Pat was out of sight on an upper step of the formation, about 50 meters above her.

The purpose of the trip (on December 2, 1992) was to complete a multi-pitch climb. De Grazia was selected because it provided good “exposure” with moderate difficulty. The
description in the guide book led us to believe that the third pitch was the most difficult and the only pitch rated 5.7 followed by two pitches of lesser difficulty.
We left home an hour off schedule and the approach took an hour more than planned. We ate a quick lunch and began climbing around 1130. After finishing the third pitch, we estimated the sun would set in a few hours. We decided to continue up expecting the last two pitches would not take as long as the third pitch.

On Saturday, April 6, while waiting for a friend at a local area called Taylors Falls, I did some easy soloing and some bouldering. I chose a crack route that was overhanging and has an excellent landing. After climbing the route, I chose to down climb. At slightly over one meter from the ground, I chose to jump. My left toe caught on a small ledge about eight inches above the ground causing me to fall backward. I heard a “snap,” took off my rock shoe and checked my left ankle for damage. There was no swelling and only slight pain. I walked to a crag about a mile away and continued to climb. During the day the swelling increased. An X-ray revealed a fractured ankle which required surgery to repair.

With time left in the day, he decided to ascend and traverse a nearby ridge on skis. The ridge rises from Sapphire Col and ends at Asulkan Pass, comprising three main peaks, all about 2800 meters in elevation and 200 meters above the hut. After traversing Castor and Pollux, Greg attempted to look over the east face of Mount Leda from near its summit, toward Asulkan Pass. He was unable to get the view he wanted, so he removed his skis and walked closer to the edge. The snow cornice which had built up over a nearly vertical rock face about 30 meters high collapsed under him and he fell down the rock and into a steep, narrow gully bounded by snow slopes.

On May 17, after several attempts on a pitch (short) on Eight Mile Buttress, Jeff Wright (37) climbed back to the high point to clean the protection. Because he was already fatigued, he clipped into a fixed nut at the high point to rest before down climbing.

On July 7, Duane Morrison (34) set out with eleven other climbers of the Seattle Mountaineers to climb Mount Shuksan in the North Cascades National Park. The route was the Sulfide Glacier Route. Seven in the party had never climbed before.
After a slow ascent due to the inexperience of one of the climbers on his rope team, the summit was reached at 1230. To expedite the descent, the decision was made by the leader to rappel off the summit pyramid, although most of the other climbing teams that day were using snow chutes and ice ax belays to get down.
Duane completed the first rappel uneventfully and had just started the second rappel when the rock horn that had been used for the rappel anchor fragmented. This was after five other climbers had successfully used the same anchor. Duane tumbled backward down a 70 to 80 degree slope. The fall was estimated to be 180 feet.

On March 12,1993, a male climber (early 20s) was leading Coyote in the Bushes (5.10a) on Feudal Wall above campsite 7. He was belayed. He moved past the first two bolts and up to a spot where the guidebook (Rock Climbs of Indian Cove by Alan Bartlett) says there is a fixed pin. That pin is no longer there. The belayer saw that the victim was angry that the pin was not there and seemed to be nervous about the long run out to the next bolt. He continued to climb, however. He had almost reached the last bolt, approximately 20 feet above his last piece of protection, when he fell. Witnesses said that when clipping the last bolt, he had left the rope running crosswise behind his body. This caused him to twist and fall head first. He fell approximately 35 feet and landed on his shoulders and his head on a rock ledge. The impact caused a fatal blow to the back of his skull.

They had planned this trip the previous day while viewing the area from Little Sifton, judging the snow conditions would be better there than in some other areas.
Upon ascending into the bowl below Bruins Pass, they chose to travel east and north through it, as that route was indicated on their map while other routes were obscured by low cloud and snow. In the upper basin, they traveled high on the east side, staying close to rock outcrops to minimize avalanche potential.

On March 20, 1993, three experienced mountaineers set out from Highway 93 near the Columbia Icefield to climb “Slipstream,” a serious waterfall climb on the shoulder of Snow Dome. The sky was clear, but a storm system was expected to move through the area later in the day. Some time during the climb, an avalanche swept the entire climbing party off the route and into crevasses near its base. All three climbers perished.
Wardens in Jasper National Park were notified the following day that the climbers were overdue, but due to poor visibility and extreme avalanche hazard, rescuers were not able to determine the whereabouts and condition of the climbing party for three days. On March 24, articles of clothing and climbing equipment were found in avalanche debris below the route. Periodic searches of the area were conducted by the Warden Service over the next two months, and the remains of all three climbers were recovered.

On May 24, the expedition split into two groups for the climb to the summit. Both groups made the summit. It took them 9.5 hours round trip from 17,000 feet. Don Cook said the groups were determined to make the summit partly because of their previous failure, and mostly to the forecast that included deteriorating weather. The climbers were exhausted from the summit climb. They ate and drank very little that night and the next morning. A rest day was proposed to gain strength for the descent to 14,000 feet. This idea was abandoned because the weather conditions at 14,000 feet were reported to be fair, and at their present position the weather was deteriorating.

They left the following morning, at 0800, for Denali Pass. Upon reaching 18,200 feet, Manelshagen noticed several fingers that had turned white and she had no feeling in either foot. She returned to the 17,200 foot camp along with her two climbing partners. Members of the Jon and Deborah Waterman “ESPN” Expedition examined her feet, finding frostbite on both. They recommended that she descend to the Ranger Camp at 14,200 feet. The “ESPN” Expedition notified the ranger camp concerning the incident and said that Manelshagen was not descending until Helmut and Pinggera finished climbing to the summit.

The three member team was attempting the West Rib after losing the fourth member to altitude sickness on the West Buttress. They had reorganized at the 7,200 foot base camp. Ramirez was a solo climber who joined the expedition after talking with the members and deciding they would combine forces for safety. On June 9, the expedition moved camp up to the “North East Fork,” on the Kahiltna Glacier. They spent the next four days climbing to the 11,000 foot camp, where they began preparing to ascend the couloir above.
The Choolian expedition started climbing the couloir during the day around 1100 in two person rope teams.

On June 16, 1993, around 1630, Erika Heine (19) and Tracy Walker (29) stuck their rope while rappelling on the Royal Arches descent route. They were at the third rappel station. They had tied a knot into the end of the rope as a safety precaution. While they were pulling the ropes through the upper anchor, the end with the knot got away from them and was out of reach before they realized it. After several attempts to get to it, they realized they would need assistance to get off the route.

They just forgot about the knot until it was too late. They pulled the ropes, hoping the knot would go through. It didn’t.

As a result of poor visibility, fatigue, and the exposure of the descent route, the woman decided not to continue.

His expedition, consisting of three other members, rapidly ascended to the high camp in six days, where Tesar contracted Pulmonary and Cerebral Edema. His condition was made worse by cooking inside their tent for two hours without any vents opened. Poor weather prevented an airlift. An eight hour evacuation down the rescue gully commenced at 1920 on June 28, lowering Tesar to the 14,200 foot Ranger Station by Park Personnel, mountain guides and members of the Tesar party.

After climbing back up to the .75 Camalot that he had fallen on, Haagensen, at Beckwith s request, backed up the piece with a #3 Metolious TCU before lowering. With Haagensen about 35 feet above the belay ledge, Beckwith allowed the rope to pass completely through the ATC he was belaying with, dropping Haagensen past the belay ledge, and onto a small ledge slightly to the left. A pair of climbers nearby, one of whom was a first responder, abandoned their climb to help assess Hasgensen s injuries, while Soo descended to the ranger station to report the accident. Almost a dozen rangers ended up hauling the necessary medical gear (02 tanks, ","Serious, Descent, Roped, Trad Climbing, No Helmet, Ledge Fall, No Backup or End Knot, Lowering Error, grade:5.8",,

Analysis
The victim was wearing a climbing helmet at the time he fell, and it may have saved him from head injuries, as the fall involved a pendulum onto the rock.

(The following excerpt from George Hurley’s personal “Newsletter"" he sends out at least twice a year captures the summer accident scene in New Hampshire. George’s letters (a) are full of valuable, pithy, interesting, and useful information, and (b) certainly are way ahead of Christmas letters!)
Early this rock climbing season two climbers fell down the wet 45° slab at the north end of Cathedral. (This is the slab above the orange gate on Cathedral Ledge road; the slab becomes a popular ice climb in the winter.) They suffered abrasions and bruises. Three years ago a climber died in a similar accident at the same place. The two women this year and the man three years ago were trying to find a path to the top of the Practice Slab.

On January 4, 1994, M.M. (33) and three companions had hiked to the base of the frozen waterfall called Stairway to Heaven. Small pieces of ice had come down from a large icicle which did not connect at its base that was above and to the right of the climb. The victim led the pitch, set up a top rope, lowered, and was belaying another climber when a large icicle broke off spontaneously from approximately 100 feet above and 50 feet to the right of the top rope anchor. The ice block hit a ledge and broke apart into smaller pieces and bounced and rolled toward the victim in the form of an ice avalanche. It came so fast that the victim was unable to get out of its way. It knocked him off his feet. He landed approximately 25 feet from his standing belay on his back. He sustained a fracture of the right clavicle, multiple rib fractures, a small pneumothorax with subcutaneous emphysema, and a lung contusion.

On January 14, 1994, Derek Tinkham (20) and Jeremy Haas (20), both students at the University of New Hampshire, set out for a planned traverse of the Presidential Range. They camped, actually a bivouac, as they had no tent, the first night, and continued up the next day, Saturday, in extreme cold weather and wind. High on Mount Jefferson, Haas left Tinkham, who was suffering from hypothermia, in a sleeping bag. He took his mittens off to do this, and lost them in the wind. Haas continued on to the summit of
Mount Washington, arriving there after three or four hours of hiking in severe wind and cold, with his frozen hands tucked in his armpits. Fortunately for him, people in the observatory heard him knocking on the door.
He was treated as best they could for severe frostbite on his face and hands. He was then evacuated and hospitalized. Rescuers found Tinkham's body the following day.

Tracy Hemphill (19), who said she had gone rock climbing only once before, was rappelling down a rock face on Camelback Mountain about 0930 on January 16, 1994, when her hair got caught in her rappel device.
Jared Thompson (19) and David Hansen (19), both of Phoenix and experienced rock climbers, already were on the ground.
Hemphill said she had been wearing her hair up while climbing, but let it down when she decided to quit. After letting it down, she changed her mind and decided to rappel one last time.
To make matters worse, she said well-meaning hikers heard her screaming and yelling and tried to help by tugging at her rope, hoping to free her.
“But each time they pulled, I slid down and my head hurt even more,” Hemphill said, adding that her legs went numb after about 15 minutes because the harness was cutting off the circulation.
Authorities said an area hiker apparently used a portable telephone to call for help.

On January 17, 1994, Kurt Pothast (20), Mike Bell (19), David Pardue (30), Tim Park (17), and Ron Hatfield (17) were climbing Southside Route on Mount Hood. It was a very icy day. Warm days and cold nights caused water ice to form. Half of the group had reached Carter Rock when Tim Park tried to get cover from the wind behind a rock and lost footing and started sliding toward the WY East headwall. David Pardue tried to grab him and was thrown down and tried to self-arrest, but because of the hard ice the pick only went in 1/4 inch and moderately slowed him down.
Both Park and Pardue slid over 1,000 vertical feet to a runout area above White River headwall.

On February 26,1994, Monroe Couper (40) and Erik Lattey (28) left the Harvard Cabin in Huntington Ravine to climb Pinnacle Gully. They did not start the climb until noon, because they had to return to the cabin for their rope, which they discovered they had left behind. They were last seen high on the route at 1700. They did not return to the cabin that night, and a rescue effort was launched, hampered considerably by cold and wind.
The bodies of the two men were found at the edge of the Alpine Garden above Pinnacle Gully on February 28.

When the men started their climb, the sky was clear and winds were 30 mph. The wind was gusting to over 90 mph on the summit by the end of the day, and the temperature was -18° F. Rescuers assumed that the climbers were stopped by high winds and darkness.

Analysis
According to a newspaper report in the Charlotte Observer on March 15, Shawn MacDonald climbed frequently at Crowders. The day before the incident, he had been climbing with his brother and another. The park has a climber registration system, but MacDonald did not register and carried no identification. It was not until his brother came to pick him up that rangers knew who he was.
This incident caused State officials to review rock climbing policies at Crowders Mountain and the four other State parks that allow climbing. The usual dilemmas are being debated. The cliffs can’t be “patrolled,” because there aren’t enough rangers, and none of the rangers are climbers. Saying that only experienced climbers can register means they would have to have a means of figuring out what “experienced” means, and who is qualified.

On April 20, 1994, Michele Morseth, Todd McCann (26), and Walker Parke (36) flew into the Ruth Gorge. Their climbing objective was Mount Wake's North East Ridge. This route has technical mixed rock, snow, ice, and a long corniced ridge with steep steps along it. It is a difficult route that requires experience, proper planning, and commitment.
Todd McCann and Walker Parke, both from Girdwood, knew each other, and together organized the climb. Michele Morseth heard through a third party of McCann and Parke’s plans to climb while she was in Talkeetna. Morseth asked if she could join them on the climb, and was accepted. Morseth had not climbed with either Parke or McCann before this time.
The party spent several days in the gorge familiarizing themselves with the route, objective hazards, and each other. Morseth felt that Parke and McCann didn’t have that much experience.

On April 24, 1994, Ken Bokelund's (28) wife reported to the NPS that he and Kevin Andrews (30) were one day overdue from climbing the Magic Mushroom route (VI 5.10 A4) on El Capitan and were probably out of food. Although the weather was stormy, the party was experienced and well equipped with storm gear.
Rangers monitored the party by telescope for the next couple of days. They remained in a portaledge at the top of pitch 22, nine pitches from the summit, not calling for help, and apparently in no trouble. However, their ropes, fixed on the next two pitches, appeared to be frozen.
By noon on April 26, the weather was still unstable, so the rangers contacted the party with a loudspeaker. Bokelund and Andrews signalled that they were dry but needed food and that their ropes were indeed frozen.
The cheapest and quickest solution was to deliver a haul bag of food by helicopter, so a rescue aircraft was requested from Naval Air Station Lemoore.

On May 5, 1994, Andy Carson and Charles Crago triggered an avalanche and were carried 800 feet down the route they were attempting on Mount Hunter.
The team—totaling five people—was attempting the North West Basin Variation to gain the West Ridge. This is a popular variation that avoids a rock buttress on the original route. The variation joins the ridge at 12,000 feet. The basin is steep and contains hazards. There is an ice fall that periodically deposits ice blocks and debris on and across the route.
The weather pattern during the week prior to the avalanche was unstable. Temperatures ranged with lows in the negative single digits to highs in the twenties and thirties. Several weak systems moved through the area bringing snow showers with accumulations of eight inches. The winds varied in speed, sometimes reaching 30 mph, and mostly from the South East. Periodic sunshine created thin crusts on most aspects.

On the afternoon of May 14, 1994, Arlo Morrill (51), Steve Olsen (45), and Terri Buceambuso were descending the east face of Mount Teewinot after a successful morning ascent. During the descent the first member of the party to traverse the narrow couloir, Buceambuso, slipped and fell approximately eight feet, pulling with him the fresh snow and exposing an icy layer below. These conditions were communicated to Olsen and Morrill above, prompting Olsen to select a higher route across the couloir. Morrill elected to continue behind Buceambuso. A short distance below the summit notch Morrill slipped while traversing this snow-filled couloir which extends down the east face. Attempts to self-arrest with his ice axe were unsuccessful resulting in a fatal fall of approximately 2,000 feet.

On June 3, 1994, a party of five was climbing Leutholds Couloir on the west side of Mount Hood. The group reached the “hourglass” (9,200 feet) around 0815 and rested for about 20 minutes. Continuing, the lead team of three led by Rocky Henderson had made it through the steepest section and beyond where the angle eases to about 35 degrees. At 0915, as the second rope team of two was just coming out of the “hourglass,” the lower climber stumbled and yelled, “Falling.” He attempted to shove his ice ax into the snow, but it would not penetrate. The lead man was pulled off after attempting the same technique. They slid down the snow field, across a snow bridge and ended up about 1,000 feet below on the Reid Glacier. Henderson, using a cellular phone, called the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office and notified them of the accident, location, and the need for assistance. He then belayed his team back down, reaching the injured parties at 1015.

Rob, Loree, and Bob started up the scree slopes of Yamnuska under a clear blue sky on June 4, 1994, to climb the 5.8 route “Belfry” on Mount Yamnuska. By the time they reached the base of the climb, the weather was changing. Still, they felt they would complete this four-pitch route before anything serious would develop. They were about halfway up when a storm quickly moved in. Rob led the last pitch in very difficult conditions, with water, mud, and rocks funneling down off the slabs at the top of the route on him and his party. He waited for his partners to join him at the top through 45 minutes of heavy rain, but they did not move up. As it turned out, the rope was jammed in cracks in the slabs by mud and stones, and Bob and Loree were wondering why the rope was not moving. They concluded that Rob must be in trouble.

On the afternoon of June 7, 1994, David Turk and Dan Turk (25) were traversing a steep snow couloir near Paintbrush Divide when Dan Turk slipped and fell approximately 300 feet down steep snow and rock. Turk’s fall was stopped when he wrapped a small tree just prior to launching over a 30 foot cliff. Injuries included an open fracture to the lower leg and multiple deep lacerations to the head, lower back (with potential spinal injury), and legs. Rangers Jim Springer, Renny Jackson, and Mark Magnuson responded to the area, descended to Turk’s position, and stabilized his injuries. Turk was evacuated from the scene by helicopter shorthaul just prior to an approaching storm.
Analysis
The Turks were attempting to reach Paintbrush Divide at the 10,700 foot elevation.

On June 11, 1994, Artur Kruk (31) and Iri Krol (33) were descending steep snow near Spalding Falls when Krol slipped and fell approximately 100 feet, impacting rocks below. Krol sustained multiple injuries in the fall including a fractured ankle and calcaneus, and compression fractures to the lumbar vertebrae. Krol’s injuries were stabilized by Jenny Lake Rangers and he was evacuated from the scene by helicopter shorthaul.
Analysis
During his descent, Krol was using ski poles rather than his ice axe. With the use of the axe, it’s possible that a self-arrest may have prevented the accident. While ski poles can greatly aid early season travel, they are no substitute for an ice axe on steep, hard snow— unless they are equipped with a handle axe made for this reason.","Serious, Descent, Alpine/Mountaineering, Inadequate Equipment",,

A snowcat from the ski area transported the subject to an ambulance at the ski lodge.
Analysis
Glissading is a safe method of descent under the following conditions: a) climbers are experienced in the technique; b) climbers are adept at ice axe self-arrest; c) the glissade route has been previously scouted and surface conditions of snow/ice are known; d) there are no hazards threatening the route; e) the runout along the glissade route is safe; and f) the slope is not subject to avalanche or snow slides.

Analysis
Somehow, the carabiner linking the rappel rope to the sling system at the anchor point came unclipped. Though it was a locking carabiner, it was not locked—or was inadvertently unlocked, according to the report.
It is common practice to belay beginning rappellers, and many guides prefer to use two carabiners at the anchor point, especially when multiple rappels are to be done. Another unfortunate factor at climbing areas that are easily accessible is that anchor systems have “mysteriously” come undone and falling objects—such as rocks and beer bottles—come from nowhere.

“Grassi’s Ridge” is a 5.7 multi-pitch rock climb on the Wiwaxy Peaks (2704 meters) near Lake O’Hara in Yoho National Park. On July 14, 1994, S.L. and G.W., experienced climbers from Britain, set off at about 1100 to attempt this route, and at 2000 they reached a good belay station two pitches from the summit. They were not sure they could finish the climb before dark, and were contemplating a bivouac on the mountain. As they were about to start the next pitch, G.W. took off his pack to get the water out of it. When he set the pack on the ledge, it rolled off and fell into a gully 300 meters below. This left them with no survival or bivy gear, food, water, or their guide book on how to get down the descent route, just the T- shirts and pants they were wearing, and some technical climbing equipment. They started shouting for help, and campers and hikers at the nearby lodges heard them almost immediately.

On July 20, 1994, a member of the Paul Petzoldt 70th anniversary climbing party heard cries for help coming from the south face of Glencoe Spire. The stranded climber, later identified as Ron Dankert (23), was reportedly bleeding and ready to fall. This information was relayed to Rangers Renny Jackson and Jim Dorward who were near the Lower Saddle. Jackson and Dorward responded to the scene and found Dankert stuck several hundred feet up the south face. While not injured Dankert was unsure of his climbing partner’s location, fearing that he may have fallen. Dankert was assisted off Glencoe Spire by Jackson and Dorward. Other Jenny Lake Rangers who had responded to the area to assist later determined that the second climber, a Mr. Rikert, had shown up at the Lower Saddle.

On July 22, 1994, Debbie Gruneberg (19) was bouldering near the July campsite by Hallett Creek on the North Inlet Trail. She slipped and fell 20 feet, fractured her nose, a sinus, C-l and C-2 vertebrae, and also sustained internal injuries. She was carried out by the Rocky Mountain National Park SAR Team by litter with scree evac techniques, and then was flown out by helicopter.
Analysis
Gruneberg was a YMCA camp counselor chaperoning a large group of youths. Her group must be complimented for initiating the proper response for these injuries. Instead of moving her and causing possible quadriplegia, according to the flight nurse, they sent runners eleven miles to the trailhead and had the professional rescue apply full spinal precautions (backboard, cervical collar, etc.).

A party of four were starting up the bare lower ice slopes of the North Glacier on Mt. Aberdeen (3152 meters) on July 23, 1994. They were roped together with a spacing of about 10 meters, with no protection or belays. The leader fell, dragging his party down with him and nearly knocking off a party of three below them. They slid about 100 meters onto the rocks below the ice tongue. One person suffered a serious compound leg fracture and a compound elbow fracture, as well as minor injuries.

After a half hour on the lead, with two pieces of protection in place, he came down, saying he could not think clearly because of the heat, and asked B.T. to take over. With R.B. belaying and other climbers nearby, B.T. started up. After reaching R.B.'s high point, B.T. continued higher, placing one more piece and then clipping in to a fixed piton. About two meters above the piton, he fell, scraping his right hand and his torso on the rock before being stopped by the rope some seven meters below the piton.

Two climbers, R.H. and H.B. (50), were descending Mt. Collier (3216 meters) on July 25, 1994, roped together. H.B. belayed R.H. across a 40-degree snow and ice slope, then luckily asked for a belay while he crossed it himself. As he was about to move from steep rock onto the snow, he slipped and fell on his back among rocks, then slid and rolled about 12 meters over rocks before being stopped by the rope and swinging over onto the snow. He sustained painful back injuries through which he temporarily lost color vision and the use of his legs, so he was unable to continue. H.B. is certain that, without the belay, he would have dragged R.H. over a high cliff. R.H. lowered H.B. to a rock step, tied him in to an anchor, and descended alone to get help.

On July 26, 1994, D.O. (29), a sport climber, took a serious fall at the Back of the Lake, a rock climbing area at Lake Louise. The accident occurred on a one-pitch climb called Swamp Thing (5.9) after D.O. inadvertently climbed past the top station of the route. When he realized his error, he decided to ‘lower out,’ using a # 1 stopper as his anchor. On the way down, he had just removed a # 5 stopper when the top anchor pulled out. He fell about twelve meters and landed among rocks in a shallow pond at the foot of the climb. Other climbers quickly got him out of the water, but he had a severe compound leg fracture, spinal fracture, sprained ankle, and various other injuries.

D.O. relied on a single-placement anchor, then further compromised the odds when he recovered his protection on the way down.

They decided to climb a steep rock and snow couloir to the crest of a ridge. About 1245, after climbing several hundred meters, Jones decided to cross the couloir to gain the final rock, and stepped across to reach a waist-level ledge on which a boulder of about 0.2 cubic meter rested. He merely touched the boulder, but it immediately slid toward him, hitting him just below the waist and pushing him over. Jones fell some four meters with it before he stopped, and the boulder continued down the gully, brushing Kendrick, who did his best to evade it.

During the evening a helicopter search revealed an unresponsive climber lying head down in a gully about the 9,500 foot level on the east face of the summit ridge. A second search on the 30th found the gully to be extremely raked by rockfall, and the climber could not be located. It was surmised that Mr. Hermens was swept down the gully and most likely into a crevasse. Due to copious rockfall, further recovery efforts were suspended. A party on the Jefferson Glacier route had sighted a lone climber above them on the 28th. A summit register entry for that date revealed that Mr. Hermens had reached the summit and expressed concerns about how to descend.

On August 1, 1994, a party of two were overdue on the East Ridge route of Mt. Temple (3544 meters). A search was initiated and they were located below the Black Towers, off route, exhausted, and still a long way from the summit. They requested assistance and were heli-slung out by the rescue team.

They were into their third day on the route, having routefinding difficulties, and were exhausted. They were also evacuated by helicopter sling.

The East Ridge is a popular objective and is well documented in the literature. Unfortunately, due to the moderate grade (IV 5.7), it is often underestimated.

On August 19, 1994, a group of six experienced mountaineers, most of whom had done over one hundred peaks in the High Sierra, were climbing the North-Northeast Ridge of Norman Clyde Peak. Each climber was well within his/her technical ability and had many years of experience. They were on a fourth class section of the climb at an elevation of about 13,000 feet. The group was climbing unroped, and the victim, Ursula Slager (68) had a helmet. But it was in her pack.
Slager was the trailing member of the group. Other group members heard rockfall from below, looked back, and saw her falling. There was no rockfall from above and nobody was watching as the initial fall occurred, so it is presumed that she either slipped or pulled out a loose hold. She came to rest on a ledge 150 feet below.

He was down climbing to the belay when he fell about 20 feet, landing on a ledge and blowing out his knee. He was unable to descend, so his teammates secured him to the ledge and decided to call for a rescue. He and a companion remained on the ledge for the night. Of the four remaining members, two set up camp at Iceberg Lake and two went to the trail head to call for the rescue.

We didn’t fully communicate intentions, and decisions were made once I reached the top via yelling questions and answers to each other. Prior to my climb we didn’t do any “buddy checks.” I ended up doing a top belay for a large man. I had clipped in incorrectly, using a carabiner through a gear clip on my harness rather than the harness itself. Consequently, when Mike fell, I was ripped from the top.

BJ (48) was found resting in a gully on Mount Morans south face. He was cradling a broken arm when rescuers were able to haul him out by helicopter about 0815, said Mark Magnuson, Jenny Lake subdistrict ranger. He was transported to St. John s Hospital, where he was treated and released.
The climbers had left their Jackson Lake campsite Friday morning, planning to climb the Skillet Glacier route up Moran and return by the same route that night, Magnuson said. The pair reached the top too late to begin their descent Friday.
Carrying only a small supply of food and water, they spent the night at the summit without a tent or sleeping bags. Temperatures dipped below freezing.

RK (23) and JG (20) died of multiple injuries late Friday, September 17, or early Saturday, September 18, 1993, when they fell while climbing the South Buttress of Mount Moran. SG (20) survived the fall and was evacuated from the mountain about 2000 on September 18. The bodies of RK and JG were recovered on September 19. All three climbers were employees at Signal Mountain Lodge.
The accident occurred when the climbers were descending the Direct South Buttress route and a rappel anchor failed. RK and JG, who were both attached to the anchor, fell an estimated 200 to 300 feet. While inconclusive at this time, it is believed that SG was also tied to the anchor and suffered the same fall.
SG sustained fractured vertebrae, puncture wounds, a three-inch full-depth laceration to the scalp, concussion, and multiple bruises.

In early April of 1994, Martin Martinez’ climbing partner vanished after a cornice gave way, resulting in a long plunge down the side of a deep couloir in the Knik Valley, near Palmer.
Martinez said he didn’t see her fall. He crawled out onto the snow and called her name. There was no response, and finally Martinez trudged home, convinced his partner was dead. But that night, he said, he dreamed she was standing at the foot of his bed and he knew he had to go back.
“I wasn’t sure if she was dead, and I couldn’t deal with myself. I couldn’t leave her there to die a slow death. She’s like (sic) my climbing partner.”
So on Thursday morning, the 33-year-old tree seller called Dave Botich of Mountain Helicopters and persuaded him to help. Botich said Martinez didn’t have much money, but he said he could pay with gold nuggets.

Analysis
This start of Pear Buttress is infamous for shedding itself of aspirant climbers. There is no protection for nearly 30 feet, yet this start is more popular than the off-width chimney, often wet, which is the alternative. You assume a sporting risk by deciding to lead this, and sometimes one loses. Charis-Mink was a 5.8 lead climber, and unprotected 5.7 may have been over-extending himself.

Eva landed on the surface near the crevasse, and was likely not seriously injured because she untied from the rope and began a solo escape from the east face.

About 1245 on January 8, Sam Woodward (50), an experienced climber from Surry, was almost at the top of a 70 foot ice route called “The Bulge” when he fell. He does not remember the cause of the fall.
Woodward had placed an ice screw about 30 feet above the start of the route. He then ran out the rope on easier angled ice with no additional protection. Park Ranger Jim Glover is quoted in the Bangor Daily News (January 9, 1995): “When the climber fell, his partner had no chance to hold him. The belayer did a pretty heads-up thing by jumping down ten feet to get tension on the rope, but he was unsuccessful.”
Woodward landed on an ice covered trail at the base of the route. He remained conscious but he had trouble breathing and he had no sensation in his legs. It was later determined that internal bleeding put pressure on his lungs, and that his spinal cord was severed. He will not regain the use of his legs.

They failed to find the top of the Escape Hatch and instead continued down the trailless Raymond Cataract, the shallow gully between the major ravines. About 1430, Rogers fell into a spruce trap and twisted his left knee, tearing the meniscus (cartilage). He could not move his knee. Landry went for help, leaving Rogers about 1600. Landry reached the Harvard Cabin about 1700, but found no one there. There was no radio because it had been removed the previous day for repairs.

Sometime on February 24, two ice climbers (both 20) were hit by an avalanche while climbing the waterfall route “Urs Hole”, near Banff. Both died. One body was located the next day; the other was not recovered until the following summer.
The Urs Hole is a deep gully containing several ice steps leading up to a 25-meter, grade-three pitch. This gully is below a huge bowl that drains much of the South Face of Cascade Mountain. Unseasonably mild and stormy conditions were predicted for the day of the climb, and in fact a drizzle set in around noon and continued until the next morning. The climbers had started out around mid-morning, so they likely reached the key pitch, well up the gully, after the rainfall had begun.

Chris went first, and after descending about ten meters, her right foot slipped, sending her swinging against the wall with her right side.

A group of thirteen Taiwanese were training for an Everest expedition. Twelve of the group flew into 7,200 foot base camp on May 31, with the final team member arriving on June 8. Four team members, Chang Yang-Du, Kuang Ming Wang, Chang Shun Ming, and Tyi-Hone Cheng, climbed to 17,200 feet on June 8. Chang Shun Ming and Tyi- Hone Cheng left from 17,000 feet on June 9, went to the summit, then returned to 17,000 feet, picked up the two remaining team members and left. These four team members were not involved in the rescue in any way, except in that they were part of the original group that came to climb and train on Denali.
Eight more of the party climbed to 17,000 feet, and prepared for summit bids. By June 13 they felt ready to make their summit attempt. Seven of them left 17,000 feet at 1000 on June 13.

On June 9, a Spanish climber fell 4,000 feet to his death on Mount McKinley while two of his fellow countrymen clung to a frosty perch just below the summit until they were rescued with a litter after 2300.
The death came near the end of a day of efforts to rescue the three Spaniards, including one attempt in which a Park Service helicopter nearly crashed while trying to bring the climbers down from the 19,200 foot level.
Earlier in the day, National Park Service officials had tried to reach the three men with a high-altitude helicopter, but nearly crashed after a climbing rope hit its tail rotor. The helicopter had to fly down to the base camp to await a mechanical inspection and was later grounded. With the Park Service’s only chopper out of commission, U.S. Army Chinook helicopters from Fort Wainwright near Fairbanks were requested to fly to Talkeetna and stand by for a possible rescue.

The two Yakima County employees were not novice climbers. Rieker had been climbing since the early 1980s, Buzzard since 1978. Nor were they strangers to Mount Stuart. This was Buzzard’s fourth climb, and Rieker had at least five previous climbs on the mountain. They also had made numerous climbs together.
They reached the summit about 0645. Instead of returning the same way, they headed east to the Cascadian Couloir, which is generally considered one of the least difficult routes on the mountain. Not far from the summit, they reached a long, steep snow slope where they began glissading, a standard mountaineering practice of sliding while using an ice ax to control speed. Buzzard went first.

On July 15, at 1030, Robert Gould (53) and Kenneth Brenneman (55) left Bear Lake trailhead to do an ascent of the Northcutt-Carter Route on Hallett Peak. Upon arrival at the base of the North Face, they realized that their start was too late. So at noon, they began to climb the Hallett Chimney (III 5.6, A2) because they thought that this would be a fast and easy route. The chimney was wet and had patches of snow in parts, causing the climbers to move slowly and resort to aid at one point. At 1845, about 300 feet from the top of the route, Gould took a 35 foot fall on wet and muddy rock, becoming unconscious and unresponsive. Brenneman lowered Gould to the side of a snow field, tied off Gould at two points on his harness, placed all extra clothing on Gould, and rappelled ten 70-foot rope lengths to the base of the face. He then reported the accident to Rocky Mountain National Park SAR team.

Analysis
“It’s a very attractive climb. It's a very beautiful mountain and it’s attractive from a distance... and the approach from the south side is relatively short,” said Ellensburg resident Fred Stanley (51), who along with famed Seattle climber Jim Wickwire pioneered the first ascent of a wall known as the Great Gendarme on Mount Stuart in 1964.
The 1979 publication of “Fifty Classic Climbs,” which includes a Mount Stuart route, helped further popularize the mountain, he said. Stanley said most accidents occur on the south side for several reasons. As the easier way up, the south side attracts less experienced climbers.

On July 22, D. E.(52) started up the Athabasca Glacier on his way to Mt. Columbia, and reached its summit (3748 meters) in a whiteout at 1600. Starting out toward the road, he biwied on the ice field south of Snow dome. Next morning he broke camp at 1000, intending to descend the Athabasca Glacier, but again in a whiteout, he got disoriented and reached steep terrain south of Mt. Andromeda. Then, thinking he was somewhere to the north, he turned south, hoping to descend Saskatchewan Glacier; however, in reality he was heading down Castle Guard Glacier. Continuing well below tree line, he realized something was wrong, turned back, and camped that night below the glacier.

On July 24, Laura and Marty went to the Canadian Rockies for a climbing trip, hoping to do a few routes in the Bow Corridor. Starting at Kid Goat Buttress, they had a good time on “Twilight Zone,” found the north descent gully, and then proceeded up “Keelhaul Wall,” another 5.6.
They combined the first two pitches into one with their 60-meter rope, and then on the third pitch, Marty continued past the trees, as it seemed better to belay a little higher up. Unfortunately it was hard to find a good belay stance, and when he did, his three placements were spread far apart and so he had to use the rope to link them all together. That made it difficult to rearrange for Laura to take over the belay, so she decided to lead the last pitch. That pitch was rated 5.5, and Laura was solid on 5.7's, so they were confident she could do it.

On July 28, a party of four climbers were involved in an avalanche at about the 4600- meter level on the East Ridge of Mt. Logan, a short distance above their camp. Although no one was seriously injured, two of them were shaken up, and they lost some climbing equipment and food. They made their way back to the camp, and were able to radio out for assistance.
The following day, a team was dispatched and dropped groceries, gear, and another radio into their camp. They felt that the current snow conditions made the route too dangerous to descend with the gear they had left, so they were evacuated by helicopter sling to the base of the mountain, and then flown out to the highway at the south end of Kluane Lake.

On August 6, Emily Town (19) was leading an estimated 240 foot climb up Stripe Rock when she and her father Glen Town, who was lowering her down the rock, ran out of rope, according to Wallace Keck, Assistant Reserve Manager. She died instantly from severe head trauma, according to Cassia County Coroner Paul Young.
Analysis
Apparently Ms. Town had climbed past the base of the third stage and was descending back to it when the last of the rope slipped through her father's hands before he realized what was happening. Mr. Town probably did not realize how high his daughter had climbed and that he did not have enough rope to lower her.
Errors in belaying—which safeguards climbers with a rope—are a common cause of accidents, Keck said. The park has had four similar accidents in the last five to six years, and at least one other person has been killed. But hundreds of climbers complete their routes safely each year in the reserve.

The second pitch of “The Prune” is notorious for doing in ankles here at Seneca. The count is two for the season so far. The small ledge just below the “Old Man's Traverse” ledge is a comfortable stance from which to place protection. Unfortunately, the vertical nature of the climbing above this stance almost ensures that in the event of a fall one will “toe” the ledge as one goes by it.

The other three climbers were 150 feet below anchored together. Rick Baron tried to protect the other two climbers by shielding them with his body. He was struck by a cantaloupe sized rock above his left eye. His helmet was knocked off and he was thrown backwards eight or ten feet down the slope before his anchor stopped him. He did not regain consciousness and died probably within fifteen minutes.

On September 3, R. D. and K. S. completed a new route on North Howser Spire (3400 meters), and after most of the descent, were unroped on a low-angled snow and rock slope about 200 meters from the relatively flat glacier. K. S. decided to glissade the rest of the way, even though the surrounding terrain showed bergschrunds at the bases of most rock slopes.
After sliding about 45 meters, he went over the upper wall of a ‘schrund, and fell some six meters onto a small bench, where he landed on his back. R. D. saw him disappear from view, then traversed around to reach him by an easier route, and found K. S. conscious and lucid, but slightly shocky and unable to move his legs. They decided that R.

He slid hundreds of feet on icy surface before coming to rest into rocks at Andrews Tarn. Bailey received a serious head injury, and was flown out by Rocky Mountain National Park SAR team with St. Anthony’s Flight for Life.
Analysis
No matter how experienced one is at glissading techniques (as was Bailey), it is always possible to lose control, especially when the snow is icy. Losing the ice ax can make it near impossible to self-arrest. One can roll over onto the belly with feet downhill and attempt to slow and stop by arching the back and pressing toes and elbows into the snow. This may be only partially effective or non-effective if the surface has iced up. The best prevention for this accident would’ve been the use of an ice ax leashing system.

On October 22, David Lown (29), a second year family practice resident, and three friends were descending a frozen snow slope below the Lamarck Col plateau. A series of rappels were to be set up with ice bollards for the rappels and ice screws for backup and safety anchors for those waiting to rappel. The slope was 60-70 degrees at the top and gradually decreased to 30 degrees at the base. The sides and base of the slope were surrounded by boulder fields. The four had ascended the slope the previous day without ropes and without incident, except for a borrowed crampon that came loose on Daniel Savelson while ascending. This was resecured without further problems.
David was the first to rappel the initial pitch. The pitch ended at the steepest part of the slope. Prior to removing himself from rappel, David clipped into one ice ax with a daisy chain, thus using the ax to self-belay himself. Once off rappel he set up an anchor with two screws and w","No/Little, Moderate, Experienced, Serious, Head / Brain Injury, Descent, Roped, Alpine/Mountaineering, Crampon Issues, Ice Climbing, Inadequate Protection / Pulled",,

On October 28, John Payne, Jr., Mark Plassman, and Bruce McKenzie set off for “What’s My Line,” a three-pitch 5.6 in Cochise Stronghold. The trio topped out in the early afternoon and had lunch. After lunch, they set up the rappel and Bruce headed down to the first ledge, a mere 30 feet down and as big as a living room. Next came Mark. John started his descent and screamed. He hadn’t threaded both strands through his tuber. He fell just past the ledge, glancing off, and disappeared, taking not only the rope he was tied into with him, but also the second line which he had strapped to his back. We will never know what happened to John when he roped in—he screwed up and it cost him his life. If he had started the rap eight feet to the right, he would have had a 30 foot fall.

The ice on the Black Dike did not reach all the way to the top of the route on this Thanksgiving Day, November 23. Fred Abraham (35) was forced to climb frozen moss and thin ice at the very top of the final pitch. When he was about three feet from the trees and easy ground, his tools pulled out. He fell and was caught by his next ice screw, a small Black Diamond. Because the talus bone in his ankle was broken, he set up an anchor and his partner, Brian Donelan (37), led on to the top. Brian helped Fred to the top and Fred then mainly crawled to their truck, taking about four-nd-a-half hours for the descent.

Fred thinks that there may have been a bulge of ice under the handle of his ice tool and he may have levered the tool out because of that.

On November 30, Stefan Mitrovich (26) and Rob (19) were climbing the Mummy’s second pitch (150 feet, 3+/4-). Stefan led out the initial 100 foot, 70° slope with one placement (a titanium and Snarg screw equalized) just below the final steep curtain. Five to ten feet from the top, Stefan paused to reattach a crampon to his boot and figure out the next sequence of moves. After several minutes passed, his two ice tools popped out and the surrounding ice fractured. During his 30-45 foot fall, with stretch from his single 8.8 mm rope, the crampons, tools, and helmet fell off him. Fortunately, the fall caused no serious injury (a bruised elbow). Stefan was able to hike out by himself.

On December 2, Greg Levine (28) and a female companion decided to retreat from the first pitch of Hand Over Hand (I, 5.7) on Batman Rock at Lumpy Ridge. Levine, the leader, allowed his friend to rappel from a station of two stoppers he had set. When Levine's turn came to rappel, he removed one of the stoppers.

On December 29, two ice climbers were on the second pitch of the left side of the Weeping Wall (grade IV) when the leader dislodged a chunk of ice onto his belayer. The victim, a 19-year old university student, was wearing a helmet, but was struck on the back of the head when he ducked, and was knocked unconscious. It was a busy day at the Weeping Wall, and nearby climbers helped to lower him to the base of the climb. He was evacuated to Banff by helicopter, and then transferred to hospital in Calgary. He had suffered a severe concussion, but recovered.
Analysis
Proper location of the belay is one of the essential skills in waterfall climbing, since falling ice is almost a certainty. The main variable is the amount. On an open face like this, the belay should be off to one side, the longer the pitch, the more to the side. If the belayer still finds himself in the line of fire, he can obtain additional protection by holding a pack over his head, es","Serious, Head / Brain Injury, Roped, Ice Climbing, Poor Position, Object Dropped/Dislodged",62.0,40.0

On May 6, after belaying his partners down a 20 to 30 foot cliff, the victim (39) fell about 30 feet while rappelling. A Ranger found a red sling girth hitched around a tree with no knot in it. Apparently the victim placed the red sling around the tree and added a descending ring, but did not securely tie off the sling. The descending ring, rappelling device and locking carabiner were all securely attached to the victim.

On May 11, Robert Gray of the “CFS” party twisted his back at the 14,200 foot camp on the West Buttress of Mt. McKinley. Gray’s condition deteriorated over the next several days, and by the 13th he could not walk. Their party requested assistance from the 14,200 foot Ranger Station at 1230 on the 13th. On the 14th, two NPS VIP’s delivered food, fuel and medicine to the party. Gray improved enough on the 15th to be able to descend without assistance down the mountain, flying out on the 17th.

The “CFS” party handled their situation as well as could be expected considering the predicament they were in. A lowering down the rescue gully is a serious matter and should only be conducted in life threatening situations where there are no other options and a helicopter evacuation is not possible.

On May 19, “Seven Summits Croatia” party of two flew into the Kahiltna Glacier with plans to summit Mt. McKinley via the Messner Couloir. They spent one day at 8000 feet, the third day at 11,000 feet, and the fourth at 14,000 feet. At this point they were forced to rest due to the rapid ascent and minor altitude sickness.
On the sixth day they reached 16,400 feet and rested a day to acclimatize better. Dolovski suffered minor headaches at this point. On the eighth day the two climbed to the 17,200-foot camp on the West Buttress to acclimate, then returned to 14,200 the following day and prepared to begin climbing early the next morning. A small high pressure system moved in and the weather was clear and cold. The two climbers left at 0200 on the tenth day to attempt the summit via the Messner Couloir. They reached the summit around 1330. At this point Ungar reports that the weather began to deteriorate.

The Spanish expedition “Lleida McKinley ’96” had eleven climbers in the group, including Juanjo Garra (32). They began their ascent of the West Buttress on May 19. On June 1 at 1300, while ascending above Denali Pass, Juanjo Garra lost a crampon causing him to fall. During the fall he sustained a comminuted fracture of the distal fibula. A Ranger patrol at 17,000 feet responded and lowered Garra to the 14,000 foot Ranger Camp where he was evacuated by a military Chinook helicopter on June 3.
Analysis
The terrain on the West Buttress of Denali above 11,000 feet is often steep, exposed, and underestimated. It is demanding on climbers’ attention and equipment. Faulty use of equipment has caused several falls on this terrain. Many first time climbers here are unfamiliar with the fit of their crampons to a pair of newly purchased overboots. Careful attention to the match and fit of this equipment is essential to safe climbing.

On May 22, the victim (29) was leading a climb on the route called Kloof on the west ridge. He was about 30 feet off the ground when he was unable to complete a move. He fell, pulling out his only piece of protection.

Because of the angle of the rock face, the protection would not hold properly.

On May 22, Terry Mitchell (22) a Willamette University student and climbing instructor, set out to free-climb, without the aid of ropes or safety devices. With him were two other experienced climbers, Mike W. Heald (22), also an instructor, and Miri Marie Anderson.
They’d climbed the rock before, and their experience had given them the confidence to try the route without ropes, said deputy Neil Mackey, search and rescue coordinator for Deschutes County.
Heald went first, making his way up a route called Monkey Face Spire, to a ledge. Mitchell went next. A little more than halfway to the top, Mitchell fell 500 feet to the ground and died. It was unclear whether he slipped or whether a handhold or foothold crumbled, searchers said.

On May 25, I was climbing at Stone Mountain, NC. Hoping to do some sport climbing (I read that the routes were sparsely bolted) I brought only a limited rack. I climbed the first pitch on the entrance to “The Great Arch” and prepared to set up a top-rope so that my wife could enjoy a climb. I tied a sling (nylon webbing) to a tree and had my wife lower me off. About halfway down it became apparent that my rope was too short. I climbed back to the top and found a lower tree to girth hitch the sling to. When I leaned back to lower off, the water knot on the sling popped open. I fell 30 feet before snagging a bush, still 60 feet off the ground. During the fall, my ankle snagged in the crack and broke in two places. Some of the local climbers set up a rope which enabled a guy to rap down to me, tie me into his harness, and then rap the rest of the way down the crag.

On May 26 they began climbing the Hotlum/Bolam Route. They left a pack with clothing, food, and insulin for Cain on the “step” at 12,000 feet and continued up the route. At 1400, Cain became altitude sick at 13,000 feet and stopped climbing. Cain wanted to turn back, so Turegun continued on to the summit (14,163 feet). As Turegun was returning to where he left Cain, a sudden snow storm hit, causing a whiteout. Turegun was unable to find the descent route and was guided back to his base camp by yelling to another climbing party. When Cain did not return to base camp by the next morning, Turegun walked out to their vehicle and drove to the USFS Ranger Station in Mount Shasta to report Cain missing.

On May 26, Stephen Ross (32) was mortally injured in a fall while leading Beverly’s Tower, a one-pitch 5.10a route at Cookie Cliff.
Beverly’s Tower is reached by scrambling up third-class ledges for about 100 feet. It follows a crack for about ten feet, then continues up a shallow (one to two feet deep) dihedral. There is a 5.10a crux low in the dihedral. Jason Hollinger (23), Ross’ partner, anchored himself to a fixed piton in a crack eight feet left of Beverly’s Tower and about one foot above his feet. He belayed with a Black Diamond ATC. Meanwhile two friends, Matthew Pearce and Nicola Woolfard, were 10 feet directly below the start of the route on the third class ledges, unroped, looking at other climbs.
Ross climbed 10 feet off the ledge and placed his only protection, a .75 Camalot with an attached 4-in. sling.

I hiked to the summit via the south side/Hogsback route before sunrise. Finding excellent snow conditions and clear, cold weather, I headed to the Sandy Glacier. Once on the Sandy Glacier, I made the critical error of failing to traverse far enough to the west. This left me at the base of the Sandy Couloir route rather than the Sandy Glacier Headwall route. I climbed the couloir to its top, where I was shocked to find rime-covered rock towers where I expected low angle snow slopes leading to the summit.

On June 21, a guided party, led by guides Chris Morris and Stacy Taniguchi flew onto the Kahiltna Glacier to begin a climb of the West Buttress route. Among the seven clients was Dennis Gum. During the following 14 days the group progressed up to the 14,200 foot level. While camped at 11,200 feet and 14,200 feet Dennis Gum was having difficulties sleeping due to chain stokes breathing. Making a carry to the 16,200 foot camp on July 4, Gum became exhausted and decided to retreat. He was accompanied by Taniguchi to the 14,200 foot camp. On July 5, Taniguchi and Morris decided to have Gum leave the mountain. Due to the location of the team at 14,200 feet, it was not feasible to have a team descend with Gum and then attempt to return. So it was decided that Taniguchi would descend along with Gum, and depart the mountain as well.
Taniguchi and Gum departed the 14,200-foot camp at 1145 on July 5. By 1800 they were at the 8,000 foot level where Taniguchi ","Serious, Descent, Roped, Alpine/Mountaineering, Cornice / Snow Bridge Collapse, Crevasse / Moat / Berschrund, Exposure, Late in Day, elevation:11200m",1.0,

After the party failed to return home, search and rescue teams were dispatched. They found the climbers at the base of the wall, and proceeded with an investigation.
Analysis
Based on careful examination of the route, the equipment left behind and the damage it sustained, the following is a possible scenario.
Carlos Abad leads the last pitch (5.6) and tops out. Jane Tennesen goes off belay, undoes her anchor, and begins climbing, with Glen Tietgen putting her on belay from below. Abad then falls from the top, zippering out the stopper he had placed and putting a major impact on a Friend, which umbrellas out. The force of his fall pulls his partners with him.

Our plan was to set up a base camp on Sunday, and then do a technical ascent of Mount Sneffles on June 24. The climb up Mount Sneffles (14,000 feet) had us crossing talus, snow, ice and rock. The climb was easy but committing, seven pitches and about 1.0 feet of 5.1 to 5.5 climbing. At the end of the climb we reached a couloir that we planned to climb the final 100 to 200 feet to the summit on. After realizing that it was time to descend whether or not we could summit, I decided to check the couloir as a possible descent route. I walked about 30 feet out onto the snow, and decided against glissading down because of the softness and 45 or 50 degree grade. Then I slipped. I didn’t have crampons on my feet for traction, nor did I have a rope on (after being roped for about eight hours that day).

There was a fatal accident on September 16 at the “Small Cliff” at Ragged Mountain in Connecticut. Following is the account of what I believe happened. At 1910, my climbing partner and I were walking down the Brierly’s driveway on our way back to our car when we came across the belayer (whose name was John), who was visibly disturbed. We quizzed him and found that an accident had occurred. The leader had fallen about 40 feet from near the top of the cliff after running it out. He was alone at the base of the right end of the cliff, unconscious but breathing. John had just phoned the police from someone’s house and was waiting to lead them up. We knew that the situation demanded our help so we grabbed a blanket from my car and sprinted to the Small Cliff. My partner stayed on the driveway at the shortest trailhead to the Small Cliff to show the rescue workers where to go and I ran to the victim.

On September 17, John Cain and Dale Ramquist climbed Mount Thompson via the West Ridge. Instead of going down the East Ridge, the normal descent route, they opted to descend by rappelling their ascent route. They reportedly had a disagreement about the quality of their first rappel anchor, and, over Cain’s objections, Ramquist proceeded to rappel. The anchor apparently failed as soon as he loaded it, precipitating a fall down the northwest corner and out of sight of Cain, taking both ropes in the process. Cain hiked out for help, presuming Ramquist had been killed in the fall.
Seattle Mountain Rescue personnel (first five, then three more) and Guardian I responded to the scene. At 0830 on the 18th, Ramquist was spotted by Guardian I. He waved. MAST’s Blackhawk helicopter arrived and the victim was extricated.
It was later learned that Ramquist’s injuries were minor, including a cut on his left leg and lots of bruising. In fact, he was ambulatory, in spite of ","Minor, Descent, Roped, Alpine/Mountaineering, Inadequate Protection / Pulled, Anchor Failure / Error, Rappel Error",43.0,37.0

On September 21, Travis Hull (28), North American Wilderness Academy school administrator and master wilderness instructor, fell to his death while teaching a beginning rescue class to the NAWA-USA Academy. The USA Academy, composed of teachers and students in grades seven through twelve, were completing the rescue course in preparation for their five week trip to Alaska when the accident occurred.
Travis had just completed a demonstration on the safety of a two point self-protecting system and had yet to hook the ropes into the system. As he extricated himself from the system, he apparently lost contact with how close he was to the edge, stepped back, lost his balance, and fell to his death.

On September 25, I was climbing with a friend in Boulder Canyon on Gorilla’s Delight (5.9+) on Dome Rock. We originally intended to climb in Eldorado Canyon, but it was raining there and was clear to the north, and the granite of Boulder Canyon beckoned. Doug had led the climb a few weeks before, and he bestowed on me the honor of the sharp end. I had been climbing well all summer, and had redpointed a number of 5.10 and 5.11 routes, both traditional and sport. I felt completely comfortable on 9+, and looked forward to a pleasant day in the sun. I was so relaxed about the climb that I left my helmet in my pack at the base. “A nice casual day on some classic pitches, and a beer at the car,” I thought to myself as we racked up.

On October 8, Joe Presuto (51) was seriously injured in a fall on the jam crack, 5.9, on Sunnyside Bench.
He protected right off the ground, placed four pieces in the first 40 feet, then ran out the last 30 feet where the difficulty eases off. When he got to the ledge and clipped the bolts, he had plenty of cams and nuts left and elected to go on. He put in a piece just above the bolts and two or three more before reaching the bulge. His partner, Kurt Harms, felt Joe should have protected again before that point, but he was already into the crux, 15 feet above his last piece, and Kurt didn’t want to excite him. He could see Joe trying to put in another piece; it looked like he was grappling with his hold and all of a sudden a finger popped out and he said, “I’m going down.”

On October 12, Jake McNelly (23) set up a rappel on a short sport climbing route at a popular cliff called Die Hard. McNelly had walked around to the top of the cliff to set up a top-rope above a half-pitch 5.8 route called Ain’t Over ’Til It’s Over. Two medium sized trees near the lip of the cliff typically are used for top rope anchors. According to the other climbers in the area, McNelly appeared to set his anchor and clip his rope into it, then tug on it before backing off the lip of the cliff, which forms a very clean, 90- degree break. At this point the climber began to free fall down the cliff. For most of the approximately 50-foot fall, he slid on his chest, ultimately landing on his right side at the base of the cliff and rolling approximately 20 feet downhill to stop at a tree.

On November 11, three climbers were ascending Olive Oil (5.7), a seven pitch route in Juniper Canyon and were on the last pitch when the belayer told the leader (46) that there was only ten feet of rope left. Shortly thereafter, the leader called, “Off belay.” About 20 minutes passed without any communication between her and her partners.
Two other parties came to the ledge, both guided. One guide climbed up to see what the delay might be. He found the leader hanging upside down, about 30 feet below a piece of protection. She had obvious head injuries and was unconscious. Both guides then climbed to her and lowered her to the ledge on top of the fifth pitch. One of them then went for help.

When New Hampshire Mountain Rescue and local paramedics arrived, they had only to put the leader into a litter and carry him out.
Analysis
The crux on the last pitch of Recompense is technically a 5.9; however, the layback moves on fingertip holds are very strenuous. Protection is very good if you can hang on long enough to place it.

On Feb. 23 around noon, a party of three were starting the descent of this Grade III, WI4 route. F.B. lowered J.P. and D.P. from a three-screw anchor. F.B. then proceeded to rappel from a single Simond 23-cm screw. The rope was draped over the head of the screw with the eye pointing up. A system was rigged on the screw which allows unwinding of the screw when the rope is retrieved. While on rappel, the anchor failed and F.B. fell about 60 feet onto shell ice on the intermediary ledge to which the first two had been lowered. He was complaining of a sore back. The rest of the party was assisted down by an ACMG guide also climbing the route. One person was sent to the trailhead to report the accident. A Warden Service rescue crew responded, and the injured climber was evacuated by heli-sling.

I broke rules. At the top, I put my mid-section over the ledge and reached for a small tree. I let footing leave rocks. The placements were marginal. Poor placement. I was out of sight of belay. Belay saved my life, as did my helmet, because I hit my head enough to cause unconsciousness.
Lesson I learned: 1) Do NOT climb beyond experience level; 2) make all placements BOMB proof before proceeding; 3) do not remove hand or feet from rock, even if you know you “got it made.” The climb ain’t over until your butt is hooked in on top.

Ice climbers were on the ice in the vicinity of Bridal Veil Falls during this warming period. The Bridal Veil Falls area in Provo Canyon is world renowned for spectacular ice climbing and it is also the location of the steepest tram in the world. That was until last year when the tram was destroyed by an avalanche.
About 1215, an avalanche came down through a chute just east of Bridal Veil Falls. It caught two roped together ice climbers, swept them off the ledge they were on and took them 250 feet down steep terrain through scattered pines and oak brush.
Other ice climbers in the vicinity responded. One of the victims was buried in about two feet of snow and they said the rope made it easy finding him. They called the Utah County Sheriff's Office on a cell phone while t","Deadly, Serious, Roped, Alpine/Mountaineering, Ice Climbing, Avalanche",,

On February 8, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department SAR unit responded to a call regarding a stranded climber on a rock face at Willow Springs. The victim (25) was rappelling when he realized his rope was too short. He had tied himself off about six feet from the end of the ropes—about 50 feet above the valley floor.
Two officers got above him, anchored a rope and lowered it to him, advising him to tie off and remain there until rescuers came. As the rescue team was getting organized, the victim self-rescued on the rope lowered to him, using a double carabiner brake.
Analysis
The victim was fortunate enough to realize his mistake before rappelling off the end of his rope, on which he had not tied a knot. He also had the presence of mind to tie himself off and then use a carabiner brake system. However, luck was on his side in trusting to a line dropped by strangers, the line tied only to an anchor of unknown origin, and without communicating to the ","Minor, Descent, Roped, Stranded / Lost / Overdue, Rappel Error",,

On February 10, a middle-aged male was attempting a solo ascent of the lower left pitch of Expert's Choice (WI4). He apparently was dragging a rope and performing a selfbelay of some fashion when he fell about 20 meters, pulling out a number of screws on the way. Despite injuries to his hand, back and neck, he was able to walk or crawl down the trail to the roadway, where his wife was waiting.

On March 2, Chad Lovelady (23) and Eric Langwager (17) decided they would go rappelling that evening on rocks behind the building where they work. Around 9:00 pm, Chad began the first rappel. About mid-way down, he noticed an overhand knot in the line. Rather than remove it, he forced it through his figure eight, continued to the bottom, and then asked Eric to remove it before descending. Eric untied the knot, tossed the rope down and began his rappel, with Chad on belay. Since it was dark and they were using a black rope, neither one could see that the rope had tangled about 60 feet from the bottom. Eric stopped just above the entanglement and tried to remove it with one hand. Due to his inexperience, he did not know how to lock off, so he tired and quickly slipped closer to the jam. This forced Chad to tighten the belay, which cinched the entanglement even more.
Rescue was called around 8:30 pm by a third party. After a basic pick-off, the climbers went on their way.

On March 18 at 2030, a party of three climbers were top- roping a waterfall in Maligne Canyon in Jasper National Park. One of the climbers was experienced, a second was intermediate, and the third was novice. The fact that they were climbing in the dark was intentional on their part, and they were using headlamps.
The last climber to finish the route was removing the anchors at the top of the climb when he fell approximately 25 meters to the canyon floor.
Park wardens were notified at 2100 by one of the climbers in the party. Wardens and paramedics were on the scene by 2130 and shortly thereafter the victim was pronounced dead. Rescue teams ground evacuated the victim from the canyon floor.
Analysis
It is difficult to determine the exact cause of the fall due to lack of direct observation, but wardens investigating the accident site believe the following scenario occurred:

Three ice climbers set out to climb Murchison Falls (180m, V, WI4) at 1000, March 27, and were at the base of the first pitch at noon. One of the climbers was ill and returned to the highway, leaving the other two to complete the climb.

At 1400 the pair were starting the third pitch. The ice was wet, and the climbers took three hours to climb the final 80 meters. Their only headlamp was left in a pack at the bottom of the climb, and they did not reach the top until dark. It took three hours for the pair to complete four rappels.

Thompson, being more experienced, was described as the leader, intent on providing instruction to Hill who had never before climbed on steep snow. Thompson was equipped with plastic boots, crampons, and a short Grivel ice tool. Hill was equipped with light Nike hiking shoes, crampons and a short Grivel ice tool borrowed from Thompson. Near 11,500 feet, Thompson and Hill put their crampons on. Within five minutes, the soft snow balled up under Thompson's crampons, causing him to slip. Thompson was unable to arrest his fall using his ice tool and slid down the snow slope picking up speed. Thompson estimates that he fell several hundred feet before falling into a “moat” (which he described as a horizontal crack in the snow separated by rock on the uphill side and snow on the downhill side). Thompson said that","No/Little, Minor, Alpine/Mountaineering, Crampon Issues, Crevasse / Moat / Berschrund",14.0,9.0

On June 7, a climber was being lowered by his partner after climbing the route, Easy Reader (5.6) at the Dihedrals in Smith Rock State Park.
After descending about 15 feet, the anchor sling failed sending the climber free falling approximately 60 feet. He landed on his feet, hip, arm and body in that order, and suffered numerous fractures.
Other climbers in his group provided immediate care until EMT's from the Redmond Fire Department arrived. About 45 minutes after the accident, he was evacuated by helicopter to a Bend, Oregon hospital.
Analysis
After the evacuation, two climbers climbed an adjacent route to inspect the anchor system. A locked carabiner remained in each hanger, and a locked and regular carabiner were on the rope. From this it was concluded that the single, equalized sling failed for some reason. The lead climber had set up the anchor system and then rappelled down to belay the climber.

On June 11, Andy March (32) was descending from the summit of Mount Hood about noon when his crampons became “iced up,” and he was unable to clear them by tapping them with his ice ax. He slipped and fell 300 feet before he was able to stop his fall.
His partner summoned help at Timberline Lodge, and a rescue team proceeded to help March down the mountain. They returned to the lodge by 7:30 p.m. March was transported to Mount Hood Medical Center for an evaluation of his chief complaint— lower back pain. (Source: Clackamas County Sheriff's Office)
(Editor’s Note: The term “iced up” most likely means consolidated snow that did not dislodge using the usual method of tapping—or giving a good whack—with one’s ice ax.

“The crack stops and the route goes over a bulge and opens up into a dihedral. I got to the top of the crack and thought there were some holds above that I couldn’t see. I tried reaching for them but didn’t find anything and that’s what initiated the fall.”
The TCU pulled out, and Gregory flipped over when his feet struck the ledge on the way down. He landed on the ground on his left shoulder blade and the side of his head after falling 20-30 ft.

Throughout the day on June 17, several expeditions passed Hiroyaki Hoshino (36) and his companions, between 18,000 feet and 19,700 feet. Everyone who passed Hoshino and was later interviewed said that Hoshino looked exhausted and shaky. A ranger patrol descending from the summit stopped to talk to Hoshino and in no uncertain terms tried to convince Hoshino to go down, but were unsuccessful. It is unlikely, but the language barrier could have been a problem in getting the point across to Hoshino.
At the “football field” (19,500 feet) Hoshino was too exhausted to go to the summit. His friends elected to continue and left Hoshino. Hoshino's friends summitted and returned for him.

On July 3, Japanese climber Hideki Inaba (33) began a solo climb of Cosmos (VI 5.9 A4). He had chosen it because he thought it was a beautiful line, a bit harder than he’d climbed to date, and he wanted to climb alone with little chance of meeting another party. (Cosmos gets few ascents.)
The climb is 28 pitches long via the direct finish; an easier but longer option traverses left on Thanksgiving Ledge from the top of pitch 22 to the West Buttress route. Inaba had not decided which way he would go, but he figured he would average 2.5-3 pitches per day. That totaled nine days, not counting four pitches he had fixed. He packed a typical assortment of wall food and 20 liters of water, allowing him two liters per day with two liters extra.

It took some time to find these overdue climbers, who were known to the rangers because they worked on the trail crew. Robison and Foster were very fit and experienced and prepared for the route they had elected. They had previously accomplished such feats as a fifty mile “day hike.” The route they had chosen was a long one, which is perhaps why they chose not to rope up.

And Chris followed independently with two ropes and the hardware.
When Chris pulled the ropes after his first rappel, he forgot to untie a safety knot he had tied in the free end of the rope. The knot jammed in the anchor on Sickle Ledge, leaving him stranded at a bolt station in the middle of the face.
Since Chris had most of the hardware, Mike and Ben tried to find other parties who might lend them gear to re-climb the route. When they failed, they decided to contact the NPS.

The climbing is moderate to the roof, but passing the roof involves difficult moves.
With his partner, Elvir Sulich (25), belaying at the base of the route, and the third member of their group, Ivica Matkovich (34), watching, Dular led to the top of the pillar. He stood on the pillar and placed his first piece of protection, a camming device just above his head.

On July 15, a party of two climbers scrambled up the standard approach for the Castle Mountain bivi hut. During the approach, they lost the rough trail and ended up off route in a series of cliff bands and gullies. The climbers were aware that they were off route but elected to continue, as they were on easy 5th Class terrain. The lower climber fell when a handhold broke away, and she tumbled several hundred meters down the mountain, suffering fatal head injuries. The Warden Service was contacted and evacuated the victim by helicopter.
Analysis
Neither climber was wearing a helmet at the time and the rope was stowed in the pack. While a helmet may not have prevented the massive head injury, the use of a rope may have.

On July 20 Mount Rainier communications received information relating to a 911 call from a climbing party on the Kautz Glacier route. The reporting climber Greg Prothman of Seattle Mountain Rescue called from Camp Hazard (11,300 feet) indicating that a party of three had been hit by falling ice from the Kautz Ice Cliff. One of the climbers, Tim Wentzer, had been seriously injured in the back and was in severe pain. Due to the location of the accident and severity of injuries, an Army Blackhawk was launched with a flight medic and flew directly to Camp Hazard. The medic was lowered to the accident scene and stabilized Wentzer in preparation for a winch raise into the Blackhawk. The Blackhawk flew Wentzer to Harborview trauma center in Seattle for treatment of a fractured C-7 vertebrae, other spinal complications and an injury to the knee.

On July 25, at 0100, David Gallegos and his brother George (26) left from Covenant Height's Camp to climb Kiener's Route (III, AI1, 5.4) on the East Face of Longs Peak. George had climbed the route previously and was to show David the way. They did not have any ropes, ice axes, gloves, or rain gear. Both men were clothed in all cotton, and had strap-on crampons which they wore over cloth boots. After ascending Lambs Slide and crossing Broadway Ledge, George Gallegos became confused and mistook the North Couloir for Kiener's Route. When part way up the North Couloir (AI 3, 5.5), George was unable to continue because of unsteady footing in the snow. The two called for help for about 45 minutes, after which David continued to the top and down the Keyhole Route, where he borrowed a cell phone to call 911.

On July 29, Don McIntyre and Joel Koury had just climbed Liberty Ridge and were forced to bivy near the summit of Rainier due to a sudden storm which deposited wet, heavy snow on the upper mountain. The team had lost the descent route in the weather and was making their way down the Emmons Glacier when Koury slipped while cleaning the wet snow from his crampons. Unable to arrest quickly in these conditions, Koury slid into McIntyre who was near the edge of the crevasse. Both fell and landed on a ledge system 25 to 30 feet below. McIntyre ruptured his aortic artery and Koury sustained knee, leg and hip injuries. McIntyre died a few hours later due to his injuries.

Two climbers had ascended Mount Andromeda and were descending via the Andromeda- Athabasca Col on July 31. Both climbers jumped across the bergschrund with crampons on. On the landing, one of the climbers caught her crampon and broke her ankle. The team was able to descend about 50 feet to more level ground. The uninjured climber descended the crevassed glacier and reported the incident. The climber was evacuated by helicopter and taken to EMS.
Analysis
This bergschrund poses many problems for climbers. Early in the season before the shrund opens up, many climbers try to jump across with crampons on, because it is less time consuming than setting up an anchor and rappelling.

Kapaun had fallen 50 to 70 feet and was not wearing a helmet. With the assistance of other climbers, Kapaun was raised from the crevasse and packaged in a rescue litter. Rangers Gauthier and Olver climbed to the site and began the lowering to meet other ground teams which were assembling in Glacier Basin for a cany out. At the base on the Inter Glacier, Kapaun's injuries were reassessed, and it was determined that he could walk out on his own with the aid of rangers.

Their intent was to follow the West branch of the Chaba river to its confluence with the East Chaba River and thence down to the Athabasca River and out to the highway at Sunwapta Falls resort. However, the West Chaba river cuts a deep gorge below the glacier, and traveling beside or above this gorge is extremely treacherous.
The river was in flood, and crossing the river was out of the question. The group felt that to continue on their route would be unreasonably hazardous, and to backtrack would make any search efforts impossible. They therefore decided to stay put and wait for evacuation.

He was able to belay himself off the route to the Mills Glacier, where other climbers assisted him until rescue personnel arrived.
Analysis
The North Chimney is notorious for loose rock problems. When climbing loose rock, one should tap holds to listen for sounds of less-than-solid connections to the rock face, and then gradually weight holds. Another technique useful for survival on rotten rock is to consciously spread out weight over multiple points of contact, pushing in instead of pulling, as is efficiently demonstrated by stemming maneuvers.

Rob, an experienced climber with an extensive resume of climbs, was leading the trip. Peter Babler and Brendan Williams were rope leaders. The remaining four participants in the climb were students in the Basic Climbing Course.
On the descent, the party returned to the platform on the West Ridge where they had left their packs. Rob decided it was better for the party to rappel over a rock step there, rather than downclimb. Red webbing on a nearby tree indicated that other climbers had rappelled there. Rob set up a single rope rappel. Peter Babler and one of the Basic Students rappelled first, and as the third member started to rappel, Rob asked him to tell the other party members to move away from the bottom of the rappel.
While the others rappelled, Rob moved about 25 feet west on the platform, away from the rappel station. What ","Experienced, Serious, Head / Brain Injury, Descent, Alpine/Mountaineering, Poor Position, Large Group, Handhold/Foothold Broke, elevation:6057m",260.0,356.0

Chierello was leading the final headwall section about 100 feet above the ground, when his tool and crampon placements failed in thin ice, causing him to fall onto a regular (29 cm) Black Diamond tubular screw. Keating was not watching the leader and was not tied into any ground anchors. Keating was yanked upward, wrenching his shoulder at such an angle as to cause a dislocation. Due to the extra rope lost from the inattentive belayer, Chierello fell approximately 30 feet fracturing his right ankle. Chierello was then lowered by his belayer to the ground.

While participating in a climb of Saska Peak on Day 17 of a Pacific Crest Outward Bound sea/mountain course, a female student (c. 20) slipped and fell on a small snow slope and was unable to self-arrest. She fell 450 feet and came to rest on a rock. The instructors quickly moved down to the site after stabilizing the rest of the group. The instructors from another group were summoned when they passed by the scene with their patrol and radio contact and a request for helicopter assistance was made with the U.S. Forest Service. Primary and secondary surveys were completed and a litter was constructed for evacuation.
While the instructors were waiting for a helicopter with winching capabilities, the student went into cardiac and respiratory arrest. CPR was performed, but was to no avail. The helicopter was able to carry out the evacuation, but the student did not survive.

In early May, two male climbers (22 and 21) started a route at Sauartown Mountain late in the day. The leader placed a cam and a stopper prior to clipping the first bolt on route. After clipping the bolt, the pair decided to back off the route because of approaching darkness. The leader decided to down climb the route, removing protection as he did so. The stopper placed earlier was stuck. To remove it the climber placed a cam above the stopper, clipped in and hung on the rope to work on the stopper. “When I yanked the stopper out, the cam popped and I fell, pulling out the cam below me. I landed on my feet and fell sort of in a sitting position on a log at the base of the climb.”
The climber sustained a compression fracture of his vertebrae and required an evacuation by Stokes County Mountain Rescue.

Two climbers requesting a rescue for a third team member on Liberty Ridge contacted Mount Rainier National Park early on June 16th. The injured climber, Talbot (60), had severely broken his lower leg during a 200-foot fall while descending the route. Unable to down-climb, his partners stabilized him at 10,000 feet on the ridge before going for help.
NPS climbing rangers assembled a rescue team and flew to the Carbon Glacier. The rescue team ascended 1,000 feet of technical mountaineering terrain to provide emergency care. Talbot was lowered 900 feet on 40 to 60 degree snow and ice slopes to the glacier at the base of Liberty Wall. There, a helicopter could land and Talbot was transported to the Park Service heli-base where an ambulance awaited. The rescue took four hours round trip.

This accident occurred as a RMI guided team was descending from the summit. Two rope teams were clipped into the same fixed line when the avalanche occurred. The avalanche caught the first rope team, which pulled two of the anchors on the fixed line. The slide continued unattested also pulling the second rope team down the hill. Finally one anchor (a picket) held at the other end of the fixed line as a few climbers became entangled at the top of the cliff- bands. What was left is detailed. One guide and one client were caught on the fixed line above the cliff. Three clients and one guide clung to the top of the cliff, tangled in the rocks and ropes.

A lucky backcountry skier survived a short burial at St. Mary's Glacier by the quick action of a couple of avalanche-savvy snowboarders. At about 10:30 AM, two skiers stood above the steep slopes above St. Mary's Lake. The first skier ventured onto the slope, and when he made his first turn, he triggered a shallow soft-slab avalanche.

About 150 yards to the south of the avalanche, a couple of well-equipped snowboarders had just ridden down along the edge of the trees and were getting ready to hike back up hill for another run. Equipped with transceivers and shovels, the pair had decided not to tackle the glacier area but to ride in the less-steep terrain just south of the lake.

On January 1 Nathan Lane (23), with the U.S. Army, was being video taped in the Amphitheater to see how fast he could descend via “Australian Rappel” (face first). Witnesses on the scene described the climber as “out of control” as soon as he began his descent. The climber let go of the rope and fell 30 feet to the base of the route.
He was conscious and alert after the accident. He suffered an open head wound and other facial lacerations. He was evacuated by Pilot Mountain rescue and EMS personnel to NC Baptist Hospital in Winston Salem.

The Australian style (also called “butterfly”) rappel has no utility in a rock- climbing environment.

On February 1, Joel McSwain (21) fell in the Amphitheater area while attempting to rappel after setting up a top rope anchor. According to his climbing partners, he was beginning his descent when the web sling securing his rappel rope to the anchor “failed.” He fell approximately 60 feet to the ground. He sustained extensive trauma, including head injuries, two broken arms, and broken ribs.
Analysis
A self-equalized anchor is only as good as the webbing, cordalette, etc., connecting all points. In this case, the knot (presumably a water knot) securing the webbing came undone. (It was either tied improperly or not tied completely.) Water knots that are used to connect webbing should be checked every time a tied sling is used in an anchor set-up. Water knots have a reputation for loosening themselves. A three-inch tail is considered minimum for this knot.

On February 22, a thirty year old female climber was walking along the base of the Rincon Wall when she was struck on the right forearm by a falling rock about the size of a climbing helmet.

Analysis
In heavily trafficked areas especially, climbers must provide immediate and clearly audible warning to anyone in the surrounding area if they dislodge a rock. Conversely, climbers should consider their position beneath another climbing party—unless they knowingly assume the associated risks.

On March 24, Russ Peterson (40) an Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Dept. SAR Officer, and J. R., LVMPD SAR Volunteer, snow shoed in to Angel Falls in Kyle Canyon to climb the Hosemonster (WI5). Snowfall had been heavy that winter and Angel Falls had frozen wide and thick on its 80-foot lower section. The upper 200-foot section was wide and thick at the base but tapered to three feet at it’s top. A steep snow slope met the base of the route with a foot wide moat separating the snow from the ice.
Peterson led the first section of ice to the large alcove below the upper section. He called down that the upper tier of ice looked solid and climbable, but that the snow in the alcove was loose and unconsolidated. They decided to take turns top-roping the lower section. Peterson established an anchor with several equalized screws and pound-ins and lowered to the base.
His partner climbed the lower pitch, removing the screws Peterson had placed on lead. A","Deadly, Roped, Top-Rope, Alpine/Mountaineering, Ice Climbing, Icefall / Serac / Ice Avalanche, grade:WI5",383.0,51.0

On March 25, a thirty-two year old female experienced climber and her partner had just completed the first pitch of Blind Faith (5.10) on the west side of the Bastille. Rather than continuing up the route or rigging a rappel, they decided to unrope and down-climb a somewhat loose, broken cleft in the cliff. During the down-climb the victim fell, falling about 50 feet to the ground. She was not tied into a rope and had no helmet on at the time. She suffered multiple lacerations to her forehead, right hand, and right ankle as well as a loss of sensation below her waist. She was later diagnosed to have fractured her spine and damaged her spinal cord.

On the afternoon of March 26, Daniel O’Malley, Tim Feitzinger, and Jeff Sukenick decided to take advantage of the nice weather to go rock climbing on Mount Minsi. O’Malley and Feitzinger began climbing an established route. Sukenick waited for his companions at the base of the pitch. During the climb, O’Malley evidently dislodged a large rock, which knocked him off the mountain. Feitzinger was in the process of catching him when the climbing rope was severed by the falling boulder. O’Malley fell another 130 to 150 feet to the talus slope below. Sukenick heard the rock hit the ground near him. When he checked it, he came upon O’Malley. Sukenick detected shallow respirations and a soft pulse.

About noon on April 18, L.C., an experienced local climber (25), was leading Blonde Dwarf (5.10) on the Magic Bus, in the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. He was 15 to 20 feet above his last protection and very close to the final anchors when a hand hold broke. According to his partners, L. C. fell about 30 feet before being caught by the rope. He was lowered to the base of the route by his partners.
Officers and volunteers of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department’s Search and Rescue unit were conducting helicopter training at the top of the Red Rock escarpment at the time. At 1220, they were notified of the incident and a team of one officer and nine volunteers was shuttled to the accident site by Air 5, an HH-1H.

On the evening of April 22, Ranger Renny Jackson received a phone call from Jackson resident Christian Beckwith. According to Beckwith, his friend Stephen Koch (29) had not returned from a solo snowboard descent on Mount Owen. Koch had planned to depart the Taggart Trailhead early on April 22, bicycle to south Jenny Lake, ski up Cascade Canyon, then climb Mount Owen via the north face. He would then attempt the first snowboard descent via the Northeast Snowfields and return that same day. As Koch is a very experienced mountaineer and snowboarder, Beckwith’s level of concern was significant.
On the morning of April 23, rangers confirmed that Koch’s vehicle was still parked in the Taggart parking lot.

On May 13, D. B. reported a climbing accident to Bow Valley Provincial Park Rangers. The accident occurred on the second pitch of the Red Shirt Route on Mount Yamnuska. The leader, C. R., took a 40-foot fall and the fixed protection sling failed on impact, resulting in the leader falling past the first belay station. C. R. hit a ledge during the fall, resulting in an injured hip. C. R. credits his pack for taking much of the force of the fall, resulting in the injury being not as serious as it could have been. The Alberta Parks rescue team was heli-slung to the area and set up C. R. for a heli-sling evacuation.

On May 17, John Bouchard and Mark Richey were climbing fast in preparation for an attempt on the Himalayan peak Latok. High on the cliff, Mark was climbing second to John when a large flake Mark had his arm behind detached from the cliff. Mark’s arm was broken as the flake, described by two other climbers as the size of the bed of a pickup truck, slid off its ledge. The flake destroyed two lower ledges on Sam’s on its way to the talus. John and Mark finished the climb and walked out on their own.

The Rainier Mountaineering, Inc. guided trip led by chief guide Phil Ershler and assistant guide Chris Hooyman began their expedition on May 21. The group, consisting of four clients and two guides, took nine days to reach the 14,200 foot camp. During this time, one of the clients was escorted to base camp and flown back to Talkeetna due to a minor foot injury. The group spent the next five nights at 14,200 feet while incorporating a carry to 17,200 feet.
On June 3 the party established camp at 17,200 feet on the West Buttress. On June 4 the party of five reached the summit in good weather, descended to their camp at 17,200 feet, and spent the night hoping to descend further the next day. On June 5 the group awoke to poor weather and decided to stay until visibility increased and winds decreased.

At 1130 on May 24, Jason Sinnes and Daniel Rowarth (29)—Burrito Brothers climbing team—decided to descend from the 17,000 foot campsite on the West Buttress route of Mount McKinley, where they had spent the previous night. They felt that weather conditions (which had been generally poor for the duration of their trip) were once again deteriorating. Mike Vanderbeek (33) and Tim Hurtado, National Park Service volunteer patrol members, had been at 17K for three days and had spent the two previous nights there. The NPS team was feeling well with “only slight headaches the night before.” They had originally planned to attempt the North Summit of the peak.

On May 26 at 1431, Australian climber John Sides (29), a member of the AUSPAT expedition, fell while descending the Rescue Gully on Denali. Sides slid 300 feet to the brink of a crevasse, then fell down into it and came to rest on a snow bridge.
The AUSPAT expedition had spent three days at High Camp (17,200 feet) waiting out bad weather to make a summit attempt on Denali. On May 26 AUSPAT made an attempt for the summit, but turned back before Denali Pass because the wind speed had increased. The three climbers decided to abandon their climb and descend to 14,200 feet. Although the weather had improved compared to the preceding three days, the higher wind speed now became a factor in their decision making. AUSPAT elected to descend the Rescue Gully because there was a fixed line in there, and the gully was thought to be less exposed than the normal route up on the ridge.
Around noon, AUSPAT began descending the old fixed line in the gully. The line","Serious, Head / Brain Injury, Descent, Unroped , Solo, Alpine/Mountaineering, Crevasse / Moat / Berschrund, Exposure, Severe Weather, Inadequate Protection / Pulled, elevation:17200m",1.0,

Calonica asked Burton to call the Park and summon help for Tosas. According to Calonica, Tosas was hypothermic and in “pretty bad shape” after spending the night “sitting in a waterfall” inside his portaledge. Tosas’ single, A-5 portaledge fly system was inadequate against the snow/rain storm they experienced the night before. Calonica did not believe Tosas would make it through another night without suffering severe hypothermia.
A rescue effort was immediately initiated to remove Tosas from El Capitan before nightfall. A two-pronged strategy was developed. First, fly the rescue team to the top of El Capitan to implement a raising/lowering system; second, fly a helicopter with winch capability to remove Tosas ","Experienced, Serious, Roped, Trad Climbing, Poor Position, Exposure, Severe Weather, Inadequate Equipment",,

The incident took place on Sunday May 31 at 10:05 PDT at the 10,700 foot level on the West Crater Rim route. The occasion was a graduation climb for The Mazamas Basic Climbing Education program.
The party was caught in a large slab avalanche. The fracture occurred about 200 vertical feet below the westernmost summit ridge near the 10,800 foot level. One rope team of three people were caught and swept down a 45–50 degree slope—through the Hot Rocks area and then the gully between Crater Rock and Castle Crags. One person was killed by trauma during the fall, a second person received a fractured pelvis possibly due to the rope breaking between her and the person killed, and a third person on the rope team experienced a fractured ankle. The leader was also briefly caught in the avalanche and experienced an ankle and a shoulder injury.

A ten-member British Army expedition “Summit to the Sea” checked into the Talkeetna Ranger Station for their briefing on June 2. Their original plan was to ascend the West Buttress, which they had changed to doing the upper West Rib, assessed as an Alaska Grade 4. The Park Service recommended they stay to the West Buttress (Grade 2), since several members had very little glacier or ice climbing experience. They would make their decision once they reached 14,200 feet on the West Buttress. The expedition departed Talkeetna on June 4. On June 14, nine members moved into the 14,200 foot camp. One member had returned to base camp a few days earlier. They acclimatized three days at 14,200 feet before ascending to a 16,200 foot camp on June 17. Ranger Roger Robinson at the 14,200 foot camp recommended that they take one or two rest days at 16,200 feet before making their summit attempt.

On June 6, around 1400, Kirk Towner (26) and I (29) were in the process of descending from Cantata Peak (5,205 feet). After glissading almost 2,000 feet down a prominent snow gully on the southwest face, we traversed the snow slope on the north side of the ice-covered glacial tarn that is the headwaters of a small creek that flows into a lower valley before emptying into Symphony Lake. Due to heavy, late-winter snow storms the area was still covered in four to six feet of packed, granular (“spring”) snow which was relatively easy to travel on, but that obscured many terrain features.
At the outlet of the lake, the slope levels off, so we removed our crampons knowing that ahead there was only one relatively easy glissade of approximately 500 feet that would take us to the valley floor.

On June 7, a thirty-nine-year-old male experienced climber had started to follow the fourth pitch of Ruper (5.8) on Redgarden Wall when he reached for a hand hold, missed and fell. The belayer cinched the rope, but since his follower had just started the pitch, there was sufficient stretch to allow the victim to contact a ledge with enough impact to rip his shoe off his left foot. He suffered a severe sprain to his left foot but was able to rappel down to the base of the climb and left the park with only minor assistance from rescue personnel.

On June 13, a twenty-one-year-old male with moderate climbing experience was seconding the second pitch of the Bulge (5.7) at Redgarden Wall when he fell about three feet. After a brief rest, he attempted the move repeatedly and failed each time. By this time, the victim was tiring and due to high wind conditions and lack of a line of sight to his belayer was unable to communicate his dilemma to the belayer above. The victim clipped into a fixed piece of hardware and did not move. He was approximately 150 feet above the ground at this point. After about half an hour of waiting, the belayer decided to tie off his rope and soloed off the route to get help, but did not inform the victim. Rescue personnel finally contacted the victim, set up an anchor above and rappelled down to him. They were able to rappel him and his gear to safety. He was not injured.

A four-person climbing team had summitted Liberty Ridge on June 14 and became separated (two roped teams of two) during their descent of the Emmons Glacier in severe winds and whiteout conditions. While route finding, the lead climber on the second rope team fell into a crevasse near 13,300 feet. The second climber, Bullard, held the fall in self-arrest for an hour while his partner ascended from the crevasse. Storm conditions intensified and the extended exposure of self-arresting caused Bullard to become wet and hypothermic.

The first climber started across the loose horizontal ledge using the rope with a rappel device as a safety. When she was about 20 meters across the ledge, she slipped and pendulumed across the face. The rope caught on the ledge about halfway between the rappel point and where she slipped.
She sustained facial lacerations, a cracked eye orbit and bruised shoulder and hip. A group of four including three certified ACMG guides were climbing nearby. They reported the accident to Warden Service Dispatch and lowered the injured climber to the base of the route. The climber was evacuated by heli-sling by a warden service rescue team to a waiting ambulance.

On June 28, two climbers ascended the East Ridge of Mount Edith Cavell, and made the summit by 1300. They began descending the East Ridge, and were over the steep section by 1500. At the head of the prominent gully which parallels the lower angled part of the ridge, they elected to remove the climbing rope and glissade the gully a short way. Recent snow and warm temperatures made conditions in the gully isothermal. A. M. was descending first and at 1510 triggered a small snow sluff which caused him to lose his footing. He started sliding down the gully and was unable to self-arrest. A. M. slid the entire length of the gully, approximately 1000 feet and came to rest just above the Col on a talus slope.

On July 8 around 2330, Yosemite dispatch received multiple 911 calls reporting cries for help coming from the wall near the Awahnee hotel. Ranger Keith Lober investigated and found two climbers calling for help above the Bathtub on the “Royal Arches” descent route. Upon arrival at the Bathtub, Lober found one climber stuck at the end of his rappel rope about 30 feet from the ground. The second climber was secure on a ledge above.
At 2345 an SAR page went out and a team of five rescuers responded. Rescuers climbed up to the stranded climber, placed anchors, and assisted him to the ground.

The weather was clear, with the temperature at 14 degrees C, and a light wind blowing from the southwest. During the night, extensive dew had formed, so both the brush and the granite slabs were wet.
Upon reaching the base of the face, the climbers put their helmets on and began scrambling through fourth class terrain on the west face towards the ridge crest.

On July 26, a party of two attempted Greenwood Route (III, 5.7) on the south Face of Mount Louis. They had difficulty following the route and found the climbing much more difficult than the 5.7 rating. Late in the day, one of the climbers was hit by a rock on the thigh. They were lost, discouraged and out of water on a south aspect during one of the hottest spells of weather recorded in the Rockies. They bivouacked with little gear (shorts and T-shirts), and at first light started yelling for help. At around 1330, a hiker passing below heard the calls and ran out to report them. A warden service rescue team responded and the pair were heli-slung off the steep face. They were dehydrated but otherwise OK.
Analysis
The party had mostly sport climbing experience. Route finding on some of the local longer limestone routes can be complex. In addition, the grades on routes put up in the sixties are sometimes considered “conservative” by modern climbers.

Ritchie had completed his lead of the route, and clipped a second rope that he had been trailing through the top anchors. Ritchie’s plan was to be lowered off the route via this second rope. However, there was miscommunication between Ritchie and his belayer, Steve Britt. Britt did not place Ritchie on belay on the second rope, and Britt had also removed the belay from the lead rope. Subsequently, when Ritchie leaned back to be lowered off the cliff, he fell unbelted from either line. Ritchie’s ground fall resulted in fractured leg, abrasions, and possible internal injuries.

He attached a two foot sling to the piece, clipped in the rope, and climbed until the piece was a couple of feet below his feet.
The climbing seemed harder than the rating at this point. He knew he was going to fall and called out, “Take,” to his belayer to warn Tomo to take in any existing slack rope","Experienced, Serious, Roped, Trad Climbing, Inadequate Protection / Pulled, grade:5.10",,107.0

Just Another Girl’s Climb (5.12) on Lower Peanuts Wall begins on a ledge about fifty feet off the ground requiring a scramble for access. On September 6, a forty-two year old male experienced climber had lowered his partner who unsuccessfully attempted a lead on this route back down to the ledge. The victim then decided to scramble to the top of the route and rappel down. The victim ran his rope through the fixed anchor and successfully rappelled for the first forty to fifty feet until he rappelled off one end of the rope. The victim then fell about twenty to thirty feet down to the ledge where his partner was still positioned. The victim fell to the ledge and continued falling the additional fifty feet to the ground. The victim did not check to see if the ends were even nor did he tie knots in the ends of the rope prior to rappelling. He was not wearing a helmet.

On September 7, Scott Davidson (54) led a short pitch, fixed an anchor and had his belayer lower him (with an ATC). The rope (50m) was too short for the task and there was no safety knot in the end. The end of the rope ran through the ATC and Davidson fell 15 feet to a ledge, then 30 feet on a slab, spraining his ankle. (Source: John Dill and Martin Ziebell, SAR Rangers, Yosemite National Park)

On September 12, J. M., F. K. and S. K. were climbing the Northeast Ridge of Ha Ling Peak near Canmore. J. M. was leading the third last pitch when he experienced some difficulty and decided to be lowered and let someone else try the lead. He was lowered off a single existing piton which pulled out, sending him down a 30-foot fall. He suffered injuries to his shoulder and ankle. The group felt they could neither continue nor lower, so F. K. contacted Kananaskis Emergency Services for assistance.
KES responded by heli-slinging two rescuers to the site. The party was evacuated singly in screamer suits. At the heli staging area, the victim refused transportation to the Canmore Hospital.

Both men were wearing crampons and using single mountaineering axes. They were roped together and were “simul-climbing” but without intermediate protection. Bateman, about one third of the way up Lamb’s Slide and in the lead, slipped on the hard-packed icy snow and failed to self-arrest. Bateman slid past Riter and pulled Riter with him.

The accident happened on September 25 at the Pinnacles Monument around noon. My climbing partner, Jamey Stowell, and I were on our fourth climb of the day, and climbing well. We were on “Cantaloupe Death” on the Monolith, a sport climb that has a trick start (5.10c) and then moves right around a slight bulge, easing into a more mellow (5.9) climb to the top. The climb itself starts not at the base of the rock, but rather from the top of a rock ledge about four feet across from the climb, about 10–12 feet above the ground. The belayer stands at ground level. To start the climb, you lean across this gap onto the face of the rock, grab some large holds, and jump onto the face and start climbing. Jamey led this climb first. When it came to my turn, I successfully struggled through the first move and was relieved that it was not as tough as I had anticipated.

Two nearby ice climbers witnessed the accident, but were unsure if the fall was due to brittle, broken ice or to faulty technique.

Ladue died in the litter of complications due to the head injury at 1900, 500 feet from the base of the route, as the park’s rescuers were working on his evacuation.
Analysis
The risks and consequences of unroped solo climbing are multiplied when the medium is ice, considering the changeable and inconsistent nature of ice. To make solo climbing safer, a self-belayed rope system may be employed. Also, the solo is often safer if the route chosen is several levels below the climber’s ability.

A small avalanche buried and killed a well-known Snowmass Village man on the backside of Aspen Mountain. The victim had spent a great day skiing with his girlfriend and other friends in the Hurricane Bowl area near Little Annie Basin.

ACCIDENT
Toward the end of the afternoon, the girlfriend realized she had forgotten her backpack at the top of Aspen Mountain, a couple of miles away. The plan was for her to snowmobile back to the top of the ski area to retrieve her pack while her boyfriend skied down to the cars. They planned to rendezvous at the parking area between 1630 and 1700 hrs. He never arrived.

The victim's last run was down the upper portion of Hurricane Bowl and then ended in a terrain trap about one-half mile above the parking area. Skiing alone, he triggered a small avalanche in a narrow, steep-sided gully.

Four skiers and two snowboarders were involved in this party. Three of these skiers (Rick, John, and Steve) had been skiing the Highlands Ridge backcountry for much of the season.

The other 2 snowboarders (Brian and Justin) were planning on their own trip to a part of Maroon Bowl, but met up with the first 4 and decided to go along.

Aspen Highlands maintains an open boundary policy whereby any skier can access the National Forest where it abuts the opened ski area. They passed through the backcountry access point on Highland Ridge and continued to Highland Peak. The route they were planning on skiing is just south of Highland Peak on the west side of the ridge.

A group of four young men (in their 20s) was visiting the Arapahoe Basin Ski Area when they decided to venture out of the area in pursuit of untracked powder. The men were skiing out-of-area in an area known as Marjorie's Bowl, just north-northeast of the ski area. Having already made one run in the area earlier in the afternoon, the group headed back to the bowl just before the lifts closed.

Two men had already skied down when the victim started down. The fourth skier started soon afterwards and likely triggered a shallow but sizable soft-slab avalanche.

When the leader was about ten meters up the pitch, a large hanging piece to the right of the route fell. It is estimated that this piece was about 36 cubic meters. The piece missed the belayer but hit the climber who was watching the leader. The main piece of ice hardly broke up and buried the climber under one meter of ice.

On February 6 at 1600, Kevin Hare (19) was leading the 5.9 traverse pitch near the top of J Crack (III, 5.9) on The Book formation. One of Hare’s feet slipped on the face climbing section of the traverse pitch. He suffered a lead fall, swinging left, back beneath the last piece of protection he had placed in the hand crack at the start of the traverse. The piece pulled out, and Hare fell 30–40 feet onto a ledge, landing on his stomach. He sustained a fractured finger, laceration to the back of his head, and bruising to his lower back. Hare’s belayer, Katelyn Shumaker, was able to lower him to the base of the route to await park rescue personnel.
Analysis
The traverse out of the J Crack is difficult and complicated by some tough route finding. One really needs to be more than just a 5.9 leader to negotiate this pitch. Because the face traverse section is completely unprotected, the final placement in the hand crack needs to be bombproof.

After breakfast and coffee, Sinjin Eberle and I set out to have a nice day for a multi pitch 5.8 climb of Hail Peak on May 9, Mother’s Day. The weather was warm and stable with a storm possibly moving in later that evening. The Sandias typically keep many climbers away because of the long approach times and thick raspberry and oak groves. We got an early start and planned to be off the climb by mid-afternoon with only a moderate pace.
As many climbers in the Sandias can attest, the old granite is great to climb, but the amount of loose rock is a major drawback, especially on approaches to many areas. The primitive approach to Hail Peak is no exception, with a two- hour fourth- and fifth-class terraced traverse that steadily gains exposure as Echo Canyon drops below.

John Repka was last seen alive descending the Muir Snowfield on May 16 during a planned day climb with the group One Step At a Time (OSAT). Repka fell behind the main group because he was feeling ill, vomiting and moving slowly Near 9,000 feet, he turned around with other group members on their descent from Camp Muir. Repka followed the team but could not keep up. Near 8,000 feet in a whiteout, a member of the group warned Repka that he was heading too far west and possibly off route. That group continued to descend believing Repka was either behind them, or that he would be met by another part of the team still descending from Muir.
When the team regrouped in the parking lot and Repka had not arrived, they began communication with him over a two-way radio (which some members were using). Repka radioed that he was near Panorama Point, but he wasn’t certain.

Tomoyasu Ishikawa (30) began his solo ascent of Mount McKinley from the Kahiltna Glacier on May 19. He arrived at the 14,200-foot camp on the 21st where he planned to climb the Messner Couloir. On May 24 at 1100, he started his ascent of the couloir. He reached the top of the couloir at 1500 where he encountered strong winds and whiteout conditions. From the top of the couloir at 19,200 feet, Ishikawa decided to bivouac. With no stove or sleeping bag, he wrapped himself in a tarp, using hand warmers for supplemental heat. He remained at this site until 13 30 on the 25th, and then he continued toward the summit.
At 1600 Ishikawa was attempting to photograph on the summit ridge when he noticed that he had frostbitten fingers. The frostbite caused him alarm, so he decided to descend the West Buttress.

While I have no memory of this accident, I have been able to reconstruct the event based upon the observations of my climbing partner, Lynn. On May 22, she and I climbed the Tunnel Route (5.6) on Orchard Rock at Peshastin Pinnacles in eastern Washington. Upon reaching the top, I tied into two bolts placed about 15 feet from the vertical edge on a 20-degree slope. Due to the distance of the bolts from the edge, I chose to tie into a long runner (a 20-ft. cordelette tied in half) to be closer for communication while belaying. About 20 ft. from the summit, Lynn was unable to reach a camming unit I had placed in a crack about 4 ft. from the route. She was able to unclip the climbing rope from the sling and proceed to the top. After a brief discussion, we decided to lower her back to the piece, giving her greater access to remove it, while allowing her to climb the most enjoyable part of the route once more.

Carey Cardon (31) and his wife Tena Cardon (29) were experienced mountaineers training for a proposed climb of Mt. McKinley. They started climbing the
Cooper Spur at 0430 on May 23. They summited about 0800 via the 2,000- foot, 50-degree snow slope that capped the 4,500-foot route above their tent. On the descent, one of the Cardons slipped just below the summit and they tumbled roped together more than 2,000 feet down the mountain to their deaths.
Analysis
The Cooper Spur Route below the summit of Mt. Hood is notoriously dangerous, having caused the deaths of at least 13 climbers preceding the Cardons. The Oregon Mountaineering Association’s route description states, “Particular caution should be taken on descent, and some climbers arrange a shuttle ... so that they may descend the standard route.” Oregon High, a Climbing Guide by Jeff Thomas states, “Do not descend Cooper Spur... during periods of hot weather, as the snow becomes excessively soft","Experienced, Deadly, Descent, Alpine/Mountaineering, Crampon Issues, Severe Weather, elevation:2000m",3.0,

Craig (25) had several years of free climbing experience but little with aid. On May 29, he and his partners, Brent and Dave, decided to get some practice by climbing the first pitch (A3) of the Sea of Dreams, a Grade VI route on El Capitan.
Craig led 30–40 feet up a crack system a few feet right of a right facing corner, and placed a cam at his high point. The Sea of Dreams crack lay about 15 feet further right, with no way to climb across, so a pendulum was in order. He was able to place a small nut a couple of feet to his right, as a pivot point; then Brent lowered him from it until he could swing over to the route, where he clipped his etrier to a fixed copperhead and started up the crack.

The pair was last seen by the Seattle climbers some distance above them, standing near a cornice. Some time later, when the Seattle climbers looked up again, the pair were gone from view. Their tracks were obliterated by blowing snow, so it was not clear whether the climbers had pushed on quickly to the summit.

On June 25 Todd Burke had led the first pitch of Organ Pipes (II, 5.6) on the Twin Owls formation. He then pulled the rope up through all pieces of protection and threw one end of the rope down to Claudine Perrault (29). The plan was for Perrault to attach their packs to the rope so that Burke could pull them up rather than return to the base to get them or carry them up die route. However, when Burke tossed the rope, it snagged, leaving the lower end 20– 30 feet above the ground. Perrault climbed unroped to the rope end and pulled on it, causing a length of slack to come free and the rope end to fall to the ground.

Analysis
Many belay devices will automatically lock if the belayer is knocked unconscious or inattentive for other reasons. The Gri-Gri is an example of one such auto locking belay device. Two key factors to remember here: The belayer must not let go with the brake hand and should be tied in to an anchor system—even if on the ground.

A cell phone call late June 30 revealed that Mike Matelich and Larry Sverdrup were stranded on Liberty Ridge and in need of assistance after dropping one of their packs. The pack was lost while breaking camp from an unplanned bivouac above Thumb Rock. Unfortunately, the pack contained their ice screws, which the team felt were necessary to safely complete the route. Complicating matters, one member was having crampon troubles and the weather was deteriorating. Another forced bivy in a crevasse and a few broken cell phone calls later expressing their concern initiated a rescue.
A helicopter was dispatched that evening and inserted teams of rangers at the base of Liberty Ridge and Camp Schurman. A cloud cap prevented flights above 10,000 feet. It was hoped that one of the teams would climb the mountain and meet the stranded climbers on route, assisting them off the mountain. Whiteouts and high winds, however, thwarted rescue plans that night.

On the morning of July 5 at approximately 0100 the “Death March 2000” expedition left basecamp to begin a climb of Mount McKinley. At 0330 Kelly Thomas (35) fell into a crevasse on the main Kahiltna Glacier at 6,800 feet. Thomas initially fell only to his waist, at which point he removed his pack and pushed it away from him. He then fell into the crevasse a distance of approximately 30 feet. Thomas’ partner, Tim Lapham (33), arrested the fall, set up an anchor and attempted to haul Thomas out. Thomas was unable to ascend due to improperly tying his ascension system into his harness prior to falling. Lapham could make very little progress due to the amount of rope drag in the system. At 0430 Lapham contacted Annie Duquette at basecamp via the CB radio and requested assistance. Ranger Meg Perdue was awakened by the radio traffic and requested more information from the team as to location and injuries.

On July 6, two climbers set out on the Northeast Ridge of Ha Ling Peak (5.6/ 5.7). The climbers got off route on the third or fourth pitch, and discovered by the sixth pitch that the climbing was much more difficult than 5.7, the protection was next to none, and the rock was loose. The lead climber decided to retreat and attempted to be lowered from a Friend placed in a shallow crack. While being lowered, both of his pieces of protection pulled out and he fell past his belayer for a total of approximately 80 meters.
The belayer, J.S., lowered to his partner, and found him conscious; however, he soon lost consciousness and stopped breathing. J.S. performed artificial respiration, but soon left to call for help.

On July 15, two inexperienced climbers (both 25) climbed Mount Charlton in the company of two American climbers whom they met on the mountain. In late afternoon, in deteriorating weather, the inexperienced pair continued from the Charlton-Unwin Col up the East Ridge of Mount Unwin towards its summit while the American climbers returned to their bivouac site. The inexperienced pair were soon engulfed in a whiteout and became disoriented and lost. They wandered around the upper mountain over numerous crevasses and to the edge of the large icefall on the North Face. Finally, they bivouacked in a shallow snow cave on Unwins’ East Ridge. The whiteout continued the next day, and the subjects became even more disoriented. They had minimal clothing, minimal food, and no water.

Okie McCornis (28) and his partner spent July 17 climbing on Shiprock, a popular climbing area located on Grandfather Mountain’s East Side. After ascending B.O.G. (5.11), both climbers began their descent by rappelling from Boardwalk (5.8), a common rappel point. Both climbers had done this rappel twice during the day. They used a single rope doubled for the descent, making use of the intermediate station approximately 70 feet up the Boardwalk face on its leftmost side.
Prior to descending they heard thunder in the distance and rain was imminent. While on rappel, Okie forgot about using the intermediate rappel point and rappelled off the end of his rope. He landed at the base of Firepoint, luckily missing the large rocks at the base of the cliff. He sustained a broken left humerus, a bruised lung, several cracked lower vertebrae, and several small cuts.

At 6:00 a.m. on July 17, five climbers started on the South Buttress of Cutthroat Peak. It was clear and warm. The climb started across a snow basin and up steep snow in the highest gully. The group continued up some steep third- class rock to where the gully opened into a notch below the ridge. Dan (34), Annette (32), and Dave (36) were ahead. They roped up and carried gear to the ridge. Todd (38) and Ken (33) left gear and climbed in rock shoes to the ridge from the left of the notch. Dave led the first half as a single running belay. Annette led all the way to an area referred to as the “Tarzan Leap.” Todd and Ken followed, climbing from fixed belays and alternating leads.
Dave, Annette, and Dan summited at 12:30 p.m. They spent only about five minutes on the summit due to threatening weather.

On the morning of July 17, David Berry and Andrew Baldyga departed Yellowstone National Park and stopped at Jenny Lake Ranger Station to obtain climbing information on Teewinot’s East Face route. Ranger Randy Benham recalls talking briefly to Berry and Baldyga about conditions on this route. He told them about the lingering snow on the East Face route and the need to cross the large snowfield in the middle of the face. Benham also mentioned the “tricky” fourth-class rock section above this snowfall. He does not remember any other particulars about this contact. Since day climbs do not require registration, most of these contacts at Jenny Lake Ranger Station are brief in duration.

On July 19, a party of two (both 38) were ascending the Northeast Ridge of
Mount Athabasca, when they encountered technical, exposed terrain. One was hesitant about climbing through this section, so the other climber offered to unrope, solo the difficult section, and drop a top rope down from above. While soloing out onto the south slopes, the climber encountered a thin veneer of ice on the rock. With both crampons and an ice ax in the thin ice, the sheet of ice gave way, and the climber fell approximately 100 meters. He sustained serious injuries to his head and both legs. Both spent the night on the mountain. The uninjured climber anchored himself to the mountain with a snow picket, but was afraid to move from his location. The next morning, with two broken legs, the injured climber crawled over the Boundary–North Glacier Col and made his way down the mountain to a telephone to call for help.

On July 27 a party of two began climbing what they thought was the popular Brewers Buttress route, II, 5.6. Unfortunately, they were one buttress too far to the north. On the first pitch, the leader fell about 20 meters with his belayer stopping him one meter above the ground. His highest piece of protection failed but the next one held him and prevented a ground fall. He sustained hand and arm fractures as well as head trauma. His partner was able to call for help with a cell phone. He was evacuated by heli-sling shortly afterwards.
Analysis
The injured climber was planning on using this multi-pitch rock route as “training ground” for alpine routes. He was wearing plastic boots. Most climbers use rock shoes in this terrain.

On July 28, Frederick Sperry (28) was attempting to lead the second pitch of the Culp Bossier Route (III, 5.8) on Hallett Peak. Sperry should have followed the crack starting off the left side of the ledge, but instead he started off route from the center of the ledge and through a small roof to an unprotected face. Sperry realized his error, but instead of down-climbing, he attempted to traverse right toward the crack on the Jackson Johnson Route. After traversing approximately 30 feet with no protection, Sperry slipped and fell 70–80 feet, including a substantial pendulum. Sperry said that as he fell he scraped his back, hurt both ankles, broke a finger, and struck his head on a ledge, causing a three-inch laceration.

On August 6 a climber was reported overdue from a solo attempt on the Kahl route, a popular snow and ice alpine climb. He had been dropped off at 0600 at the trailhead and had been expected back by evening. The Warden Service was contacted at 2030. It is relatively common for climbers to be overdue on this route and usually when parties get benighted, they return by midday the following day. However, since the climber was solo, a search was initiated at first light the following morning. The climber was located in a rock gully below a snow slope on the usual descent route. He had fallen about 200 meters down the snow slope and eventually got hung up halfway down the gully. He died of the injuries sustained during the fall, including serious head lacerations.

In the afternoon of September 9, Russ Fields (29), Bob Dunahue (36), and Bill Hesse (27) reached Long Ledge on the Salathe Wall (35 pitches, Grade VI).
Russ had the next lead, pitch 33; the topo shows it starting as Al, then finishing as 5.8 face climbing.
Comfortable on hard 5.10, he didn’t expect any problems, but about 50 feet short of the belay, he found the free moves much harder than the rating. He searched for an easier way, found nothing, and finally fell attempting the moves. His last protection, six or seven feet below, was a marginal placement—all he’d been able to find—and it failed.

On September 12, a team of four climbers was descending the Hotlum/Bolum Ridge. Two of the team went ahead to scout the descent route. One member, Rene “Red” Arnold Cuestas (32), did not return. After waiting an hour, the three remaining team members continued to descend. When they returned to basecamp, Cuestas was not there, so they contacted USFS rangers. During the ensuing search, a California Division of Forestry and Fire helicopter crew spotted Cuestas’ body at 12,000 feet. He appeared to have slipped on the ice and fallen two to three hundred feet over ice and rock. He was wearing crampons and had an ice ax girth hitched to his wrist.
Analysis
Cuestas was a novice climber. The route he was on is not technically difficult when snow conditions are good. However, the route generally becomes quite icy in the fall, making it very challenging. The party continued to climb, even though they were frightened by the conditions on the ascent. Sep","No/Little, Serious, Descent, Alpine/Mountaineering, Party Separated",4.0,

Unconscious for 15 minutes and with a severely injured scalp and nose, she was aided by climber Vince Hudson, a former medic, who described her fall as follows: “Originally she was sliding just flat. Then she went over a rock ledge and started to tumble, head over heels, and started picking up speed. Then she went over another ledge and I could see her head hit it.

On October 2, a climber (22) was on top of Courthouse Rock looking for an anchor placement for rappelling. He had his harness on but was unroped. He went near the edge and the rock broke off underneath him, resulting in his fall off the cliff of about 75 feet, with an additional 25 feet of tumbling at the bottom. His partner went to get help, and three hours later, a search and rescue team arrived and brought the victim out on a rolling backboard. He suffered a pneumothorax and fractured arms.

Rappelling is a very popular activity in this park. The victim reported that he had limited experience and was unfamiliar with the area. The sandstone in this area is unstable, but there are plenty of trees to anchor to while exploring around the top of the cliff.

Analysis
Ruit’s rope was found on the ground with carabiners attached to it. A piece of unsecured nylon webbing was found hanging from the anchor. When Ruit went to weight the rope, it apparently dropped through the 25-foot webbing, which Ruit probably thought was tied. It did not appear that there was anything wrong with the equipment or the fixed protection.

Chris Hartonas (40) and Raymond Vakili (48) disappeared while climbing to Camp Muir on November 5. Hartonas and Vakili were experienced mountaineers and both men had been to Camp Muir before. Hartonas was an avid park visitor and mountain climber, known by many on the Park Service staff for his frequent ascents to Camp Muir, particularly under adverse weather conditions.
An extensive ten-day search ensued. Park Rangers, Rainier Mountaineering Guides, Volunteer Mountain Rescue, friends of the men, and search dog teams participated. Severe weather that included heavy snowfall and rain, high winds and whiteouts hampered efforts throughout much of the operation.

Late fall in the Sierra Nevada had been mild, so in mid-December, Art (23), Robert (28), and Eric (22), all Yosemite locals, decided to climb the Direct Route on Lost Arrow Spire (13 pitches, VI 5.11 A3). They would finish in the notch between the Arrow and the main wall, roughly 300 feet below the rim. There is no enjoyable way to climb out, so it’s customary to fix ropes from the rim into the notch as an escape. Art had been down to the notch before, when climbing the Arrow Spire, so he knew where to set up; on December 13, he and Eric hiked up the Yosemite Falls Trail with the gear. Art anchored one rope, tied another onto its free end, and threw them over the edge. Then he looked from a viewpoint on the rim to confirm that the rope reached all the way down to the notch.

One case to note occurred to a man (66) who is a veteran of the cliffs. He was starting up on a fairly easy climb—Three Pines—but had placed only one piece of protection. He was 20 feet up when he fell. His protection came out, so he hit the ground and tumbled additional distance, crushing his pelvis. However, he feels strongly that his helmet saved him from possible death or at the very least mental debilitation.

Early Wednesday afternoon, two local Boulder County men were skiing the open slope above Yankee Doodle Lake when they triggered a sizable hard-slab avalanche. The avalanche struck the ice-covered lake and shattered the ice, dumping both men into the water. The pair were skilled and avalanche-savvy backcountry skiers who were well-equipped for a day in the mountains. One man died (drowned?). His friend escaped, but unable to find his missing partner, he hiked back to the Eldora ski area to get help.

This was the men's third day in a row on this slope, where two days earlier they had enjoyed terrific powder skiing. Before starting their descent, the pair dug a snow pit. Apparently satisfied with what they had found, they agreed to ski short distances one at a time, taking turns watching each other while the other would wait at a ""safe"" spot. The first man (survivor) skied a short distance to a flatter, bench area and traversed toward some rocks to avoid a much steeper cliff area","buried:2, killed:1",,

On January 15, R.P. (48) began to climb Cabin Creek Falls, a water ice Grade 2 or 3 climb, depending on the line taken. He was belayed on top-rope by M.B. Both climbers had previous ice climbing experience. The rope was tied with a figure eight knot loop with a locking carabiner attached to it for the climber to clip into his/her harness. The climbers exchanged the standard information to indicate they were both ready and R.P. started up the route.
As R.P. started up the steeper section of the climb, his hand slipped out of his tool and he fell one or two feet, leaving his ice tool in place. M.B. helped R.P. reach his ice tool by applying all her weight to the rope to help “heave” him up. From there, R.P. climbed up and over the steep section and then asked to be lowered.

On January 20, a number of parties were climbing on this popular multi-pitch water ice Grade 4+ climb near Lake Louise. One of the parties high on the route dislodged a large piece of ice which hit S.G. He sustained crushing injuries to his left foot. He was able to rappel, but unable to walk back to the trailhead. He was evacuated by snowmobile by the Park Warden Service.
Analysis
As ice climbing continues to grow in popularity, certain routes are becoming more crowded and this type of accident is becoming more common. Parties should take note of their position in relation to others above them. Choosing a different line or abandoning the climb may be the most appropriate actions.

F.B. (32) was leading the crux pitch of this water ice Grade 4+ route on February 2. He was about three meters above an ice mushroom around which he had tied a sling. His ice tool unexpectedly popped out of the ice, causing a large piece of ice to fall on the ice mushroom with the sling, breaking the mushroom off. The screw he had placed six meters below the ice mushroom held his fall. Although this was in a relatively remote area, another climber was able to call for help on his cell phone. Because of gusty winds, the Warden Service rescue crew could only be inserted below the victim by heli-sling. The crew walked up to the site and the victim was lowered and carried down to a suitable landing area. He was then evacuated to the Banff Hospital.

On February 7, Craig Dreher (30) and Gene Williamson (30) decided to abort their winter attempt of the Keyhole Route due to high winds. As they were retreating from the Boulder Field, a gust of westerly wind estimated at 150 mph knocked over Williamson and picked up Dreher (who weighs 170 pounds) free of the ground. Dreher was tossed into a pile of rocks, impacting on his right ankle, resulting in a fracture of the fibula.

Although this accident occurred on non-technical terrain, Dreher and Williamson requested that this be brought to the readers’ attention as an example of the high wind hazard prevalent on winter climbs of Longs Peak. Winds have been twice measured on the Longs Peak summit at 220 mph. It should also be mentioned that Dreher was wearing a 70-pound pack when picked up by the wind!

On May 13, The Velvet Underground Expedition, Courtland Shafer (33) and Glenn and Morrison (40) began their climb of Denali’s West Rib. On May 24, Shafer and Morrison were camped at 11,000 feet near the base of the route. Shafer and Morrison had decided to abandon their climb and return to Basecamp. They left their camp at 1300, and descended towards the upper icefall of the Northeast Fork. There were two feet of new snow, and they followed a faint trail that sloped down hill about 15 degrees.
Shafer and Morrison were aware of the crevasse danger and were traveling with the rope tight between them. Shafer was leading and probing with ski poles (baskets on), as they crossed the glacier west to east. Shafer was tied directly into a waist harness and carried some coils of rope, and a 65-pound pack.
Shafer fell through a bridge and down into the crevasse. Shafer struck the wall of the crevasse three times before coming to rest 20 fee","Serious, Descent, Roped, Alpine/Mountaineering, Crevasse / Moat / Berschrund, elevation:11000m",1.0,

May 13, Rangers Kevin Moore and Scott Metcalfe with volunteers Jay Hammond and John Evans carried loads from 14,200 feet to 16,200 feet on the West Buttress and returned to 14,200 feet. They reported the following.
We saw Erik Seedhouse (35) and Doina Nugent (38) moving slowly at 15,300 feet just below the fixed lines on the headwall. They had moved maybe 400 feet in one and a half hours. We caught up to them and asked Nugent if they were feeling all right. He replied they were all right. Seedhouse had stopped continuously, and we thought he might be demonstrating symptoms of altitude sickness. We told them the symptoms of Acute Mountain Sickness and Seedhouse agreed he might have AMS. We suggested they go down and acclimatize slowly. But Nugent said sharply to Seedhouse that he didn’t have AMS and that he was “a baby.”

The route follows a gentle approach to the Great Couloir, which at this time of year is generally filled with snow and requires crampons and ice axes to safely climb the icy snow. The couloir opens up onto the face where some easy mountaineering scrambles and crampons and mountain axes allow access of the summit ridge west of the North Summit of Olympus. Some areas before reaching the ridge during the traverse of the face require some 5.6+ rock scrambling. After reaching the ridge, we walked it down to the west side of the west slabs.

On May 15, Graeme Taylor (39) and Keith Reid (37), both experienced climbers, were in the Giant Staircase of the East Face route on Mt. Whitney. Graeme was about 40 feet out on lead when a snow mushroom he was standing on collapsed. Graeme fell 40 feet to one of the stairs. He briefly lost consciousness and suffered injuries so that he was unable to climb further. Keith placed him in a bivy sack, tied him in, and solo climbed to the top. He descended via the trail and notified the Kern County Sheriff.

On May 16 at 1840, Christoph Haider (24) fell from below Denali Pass while descending the West Buttress route. Ranger Kevin Moore and others witnessed the fall and responded to the scene where they assessed and stabilized Haider. Moore and Volunteer Ranger Jay Patterson determined he had suffered head injuries including a possible broken nose as well as a possible femur fracture. Haider was alert and able to move his toes; it was unclear if he had lost consciousness during the fall. Haider and Moore were short-hauled via the Lama helicopter from 17,000 feet to the 7,200-foot base camp where Haider was loaded into the Lama and evacuated to Talkeetna. A Lifeguard helicopter then took Haider to Providence Hospital in Anchorage, where his condition was given as stable. He had suffered a broken nose and lacerations to the head and face.

On May 26, the Casade-Dacks Expedition of Ron Fridell (50), Sid Perkins, and Don Andrews (43) flew to the Kahiltna Glacier to begin their climb of the West Buttress of Mount McKinley. Over the next five days the group proceeded to the 11,000-foot camp. On June 1, the team made a carry to 13,500 feet, which is a popular strategy for the difficult move from 11,000 feet to 14,200 feet, and returned to the lower camp. On June 2, the group was climbing past Windy Corner en route to the 14,200-foot camp when Andrews began having trouble breathing. According to Fridell, Andrews slowed down noticeably, began resting more often and developed a productive cough. Andrews’ respiratory distress became so alarming that the group stopped and Fridell continued to the 14,200-foot camp alone and without his pack in order to summon help. Fridell arrived at the NPS Ranger Camp at 2130 and reported the incident.

At 1000 on May 27, Richard Gustafson (34) and William Ross (45)—clients from two separate expeditions—were experiencing symptoms of High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE). Gustafson was with Alaska Denali Guiding and Ross was with American Alpine Institute. Evacuated by helicopter from the 17,200-foot high camp on Mount McKinley’s West Buttress route, the National Park Service Lama helicopter transported Gustafson and Ross to the 7,200-foot Basecamp where they were assessed and transferred to an Air National Guard Pavehawk helicopter, which flew them to Alaska Regional Hospital in Anchorage.
Analysis
There is little doubt that Ross and Gustafson needed to descend. Given this, there is only a question of how best to accomplish the task.

Instead, he fell about 80 feet to the base of the crag with the rope attached.
When SAR team members arrived, CH was conscious, but suffering from a femur fracture and two ankle fractures. He was immobilized in a bean-bag vacuum splint and lowered one pitch down a steep scree slope to the road, then flown by Lifeflight helicopter to the hospital.
Analysis
After DK completed the climb, he exchanged positions with CH and prepared to lower him. When he started to lower, the rope ran through his hands, burning them.

On June 20, James Frankenfield (39) and Iain Morris (23) were on the Sandy Glacier Headwall route on Mount Hood. At 0730, while traversing above the glacier to the headwall, they were involved in a major rockfall event which initiated thousands of feet above on the upper buttress of the Yokum Ridge. Both climbers were struck by rocks. One had a severely swollen hand which was not broken. The other had a more serious hip injury The two were initially able to continue, each under his own power, to a previously identified safe area. At that point the climber suffering a hip injury could not continue due to excessive shock. The two climbers assessed their situation, hoping that they could stabilize the injuries enough to descend Cathedral Ridge to Lolo Pass Road on their own. By 1230 they realized and accepted that a rescue would be necessary. They attempted to call for help on their VHF radio using the state SAR frequency, but were unsuccessful.

The story behind this accident was largely pieced together from the evidence gathered during the lengthy search that was required to locate and recover the victim’s body. The victim, P.O. (19), planned on climbing the south face of Cascade Mountain with two friends. P.O.’s day off work (June 23) arrived a day before the other two were available, so he told one of the others he would head up the lower part of the mountain alone to reconnoiter the route which they would try the next day together. When he failed to return that night, his friends notified Warden Service dispatch and a search commenced. His body was finally located on July 7.
Analysis
The south face of Cascade Mountain is 1200 meters high and consists mostly of steep scree gullies and rock slabs. In June of 2000, snow still covered about two-thirds of the route due to an unseasonably cold spring.
It was determined that P.O., using crampons and an ice ax, kicked steps in snow gu","No/Little, Deadly, Unroped , Alpine/Mountaineering, Poor Cond/Seasonal Risk, Crevasse / Moat / Berschrund, Inadequate Equipment",17.0,

On June 24, Raj Dhingra (39), my brother Hugh (34), and I—Dan Sakols (37)— decided to tackle Commitment (three pitches, 5.9), one of the “Five Open Books” west of Lower Yosemite Falls. We got an early start to avoid the crowd and finished the first two pitches, both 5.8, with no complications.
Hugh led the third pitch, which starts with 5.9 moves around the right side of a big roof, then finishes up a right-facing 5.8 corner. After Hugh climbed out of sight at the top it was impossible to communicate, even by shouting.
There were light tugs on the rope, but we had not prearranged a signal, so I was not sure if he was still setting up the anchor or wanted me to climb.

On June 25 at 1940, Ranger Meg Perdue received a radio call from Volunteer Ranger Karen Hilton at the 17,200-foot high camp regarding a solo climber
who was non-ambulatory on the traverse from Denali Pass. A guide there relayed to Hilton that he had been contacted via CB radio by a private expedition, Spirit of El Rancho, who were very concerned about this climber, Russell Worthington (29). He had been traveling with them to the summit and had vomited on the summit ridge several times and appeared ataxic. Now, upon their descent, they relayed he was unable to walk and was again vomiting. Worthington’s position was reported to be halfway between Denali Pass and the rock band that initiates the traverse above the 17,200-foot camp.
At 1947, the Spirit of El Rancho Expedition was recontacted directly by Hilton, and confirmed that Worthington was exhausted and unable to walk, but that he was alert and oriented.

On June 25, Jesse Woods (20) and Scott Kastengren were preparing to climb the third pitch of the Casual Route (IV 5.10) on the Diamond of Longs Peak when Woods was struck in the face by falling ice. He sustained lacerations to the forehead (requiring 22 sutures), a concussion, fractured nose, and hematomas surrounding both eyes. Kastengren lowered Woods back down to Broadway Ledge where they were assisted by two other climbers known as A1 and Craig. At Mills Glacier they were joined by park rescue for a helicopter evacuation.
Analysis
Late spring and early summer bring the highest incidence of falling ice with the advent of longer days and warmer temperatures. However, it is possible to encounter falling ice and falling rock (due to freeze/thaw cycles) at any other time of year on Longs Peak depending on conditions.

On June 25, my brother Andrew Betts (24) and I, Brad Betts (28), along with our friend Richard Meade (26), set out to climb the six-pitch, 5.6 Southeast Buttress of Cathedral Peak (10,940 feet). None of us had done the climb before, and it would be my first significant multi-pitch climb.
We drove up from the Bay Area the night before and camped west of the park, about 50 miles from the trailhead. We had planned to hike the three miles to the base of the route by 8:00 a.m. and be off the summit by 1:00 p.m., to avoid afternoon thunderstorms. However, we awoke at 4:00 a.m., to find that someone—not a bear—had stolen our food, and dealing with that put us two hours behind schedule.
We checked the weather board at the park entrance, but we were too early for the current forecast and the station was still closed.

On June 27, Jim Corpus (44) and Mike Penner (45) climbed the Steck-Salathe route (15 pitches, 5.9) on Sentinel Rock. They summited at sunset, took a break, and started looking for the 3rd class descent gully after dark. Despite having headlamps, they had trouble finding their way and wound up descending slabs on the south side of the gully, where they encountered lots of loose rocks.
About midnight, halfway down the slabs, with Jim 100-150 feet ahead of and below Mike, Mike’s foot dislodged a 5-10 pound rock. He yelled, “Rock!” and listened as it bounced down the face, and then called for Jim, but got no response. He scrambled down the slab and found only a headlamp where Jim should have been. Beyond the lamp, patches of blood led another 150 feet downhill to where Jim lay, unconscious and bleeding from his scalp. He was just two feet short of a 40-foot cliff that probably would have finished him off.

At sunrise on June 29, Eric Seyler (28) and Kurt Smith (26) left their bivouac high on the North Ridge of Mount Washington to climb Central Pillar, de scribed in their guide book, “Oregon High”, by Jeff Thomas, as “steep, exposed and a joy to climb.” Unable to identify the described route positively, they chose a line that looked promising. At the top of the first 90-foot pitch of blocky, straightforward rock, Eric arrived at rappel slings looped between a fixed piton and a large block. He replaced the slings with a single spectra sling stretched horizontally around the block between the fixed piton and a new passive nut placement. He belayed Kurt to a ledge below and clove hitched Kurt to the single nut at one side of the sling. Kurt set two small passive nuts and attached each of them to his harness.

On July 1, Mike Head (26) and Levois “Adolph” Garcia were attempting to climb Osiris (II 5.7) on The Book. Head, the leader, got off route on the final pitch and fell from a section of 5.10 rock as he was attempting to place protection. He pulled the next piece of protection out as he fell, sustaining a 50-foot fall and fracturing three bones in his right foot. He anchored himself to a small tree and called for Garcia to ascend to him, but Garcia was unable to climb up to Head. Head used his cell phone to contact park rescue, who responded with a night cliff evacuation. Head’s fractures were extensive, requiring surgery and a cast for two to three months.
Analysis
There were a number of smaller factors coupled with the relative inexperience of this party that led up to this accident. The pair had a guidebook with them, but did not refer to it during the climb.

On July 3, the Jones party signed out at the Jenny Lake Ranger Station as two separate groups of four to climb the Skillet Glacier route on Mount Moran. On July 4, they started across Jackson Lake in two small boats headed for the base on Mount Moran. Waves swamped their boats and they were rescued by NPS Rangers. On July 5, they were delivered to the base of Moran by a Signal Mountain shuttle boat. They climbed to the Skillet moraine and camped for the night.

On July 6, Cameron Tague (32) and Emma Williams (34) were attempting the Yellow Wall Route (V 5.11) on the Diamond of Longs Peak. Tague was climbing unroped on a steep band of rotten 4th class rock at the base of the Yellow Wall Route looking for a belay on better rock. Tague slipped on loose rock and fell 800 feet to his death over the Lower East Face and onto Mills Glacier.

Analysis

Tague was an outstanding climber with approximately 30 ascents of routes on the Diamond face, including a new route. His strategy in climbing unroped was to save time and increase his party’s margin of safety later in the day by finishing the route before the afternoon lightning storms would arrive. However, in retrospect, it may have been better to simul-climb with protection placed at intervals.

On July 12, Andy Haberkorn (28) was seconding his partner, Stanley Smigel, on a crux 5.10 pitch of the Casual Route on the Diamond of Longs Peak. As Haberkorn was about 40 feet above the Yellow Wall bivouac ledge, a bright flash of lightning was observed by Smigel in the vicinity of Haberkorn. Haberkorn had received a fatal lightning strike which entered his chest. Smigel was able to respond to his partner briefly, but Haberkorn had succumbed to his internal injuries.
Analysis
Lighting is common element of the Colorado Rockies high country. Haberkorn’s fatal strike occurred about 1500, a most dangerous time of day to be high on the face in midsummer. It was during a rather unsettled period, where lightning storms were more common than normal.

S. said that the bolt looked good when he clipped it, and suspects that the rock surrounding the bolt may have failed. Climbers should be cognizant of the fact that poor rock or poorly placed or old bolts can be prone to pulling out or breaking.

On August 5, James A. Guest (32) took a 30-foot lead fall on Pervertical Sanctuary (V 5.10) on the Diamond of Longs Peak. Guest impacted hard against both feet, resulting in fractures to both legs. His partner, Brent Moore, assisted by additional Diamond climbers Charles Lewinsohn and Eric Wass, lowered Guest down the 800-foot Lower East Face to Mills Glacier, where they were met by the park rescue team for a helicopter evacuations.
Analysis
Guest’s protection did arrest his fall, but had that protection been closer to the fall initiation point, he might not have attained the destructive force necessary to fracture both legs. Guest and Moore did a fantastic job with self-rescue, which emphasizes the importance of studying these skills. Most endearing is the example of Lewinsohn and Wass, who showed that the code of the mountains (drop your goal to help a fellow climber in need) is alive and well.

On August 10 at 7:00 pm, Kyle Brown (22) plunged 50 feet off a cliff at Papago Buttes while teaching kids from his church how to rappel.
It took rescue crews about an hour to reach Brown. Fire officials said that Brown’s head injuries suppressed his breathing, and by the time firefighters reached him, he did not have a pulse. He was admitted to Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.
Analysis
Police and fire officials said they were not sure what caused Kyle Brown to fall that night, but they think that Brown was anchored and starting his descent when the accident occurred. Bob Khan, a deputy chief with the Phoenix Fire Department, said they were not sure whether a knot used to support Brown failed or whether he lost his footing.

As usual, he had given the beginners, including Sarah, at least one day of instruction at a local climbing area to get them competent at basic skills.
By 1130 they had scrambled up the 2nd and 3rd class scree slope to the base of the first roped pitch, a 70-foot buttress blocking the gully. The Gunsight is full of loose rock, so at this point, as was his habit, David talked about rockfall hazards and made sure they all had their helmets on.
The group waited at the base of the pitch while David climbed. At the top he set down his day pack while he established an anchor. The rock surface was solid, with just a few chunks of granite scattered about, but the pack brushed a grapefruit-sized piece and sent it rolling toward the edge.","No/Little, Experienced, Serious, Roped, Trad Climbing, Poor Position, Large Group, Object Dropped/Dislodged",,

On August 18, four climbers were ascending the 45-degree snow-and-ice route on Mount Lefroy. They were traveling as two independent rope teams, moving together with short lengths of rope between the climbers. At 3400 meters, the route narrows into a gully bordered by rock. One of the lead climbers dislodged a rock which struck the lower climber, causing both members of the team to lose their balance and fall about 300 meters down the route. The other two climbers climbed down to assess and stabilize them. One climber descended to the Abbot Pass Hut to use the emergency phone. Upon discovering that the phone was not working, he began heading further down the mountain for help when he ran into another climber with a cell phone.

On September 15 about 1930, Julien Roques (20) fell 350 feet from the third pitch of the Open Book in Garnet Canyon. He sustained severe injuries during the fall resulting in his death.
Analysis
Upon investigation on the morning of September 17, it was noted that Roques was correctly attached to his rappel device and his fall initiated at the start of his rappel. Two descending rings were found attached to the rappel ropes near the victim. Since the descending rings were devoid of any part of the anchor system, investigating rangers assumed the anchor system failed on one side, allowing the descending rings to slide off the webbing or the webbing failed completely. The failed anchor system had to be at the location of their last rappel.

On Saturday November 11, Nick Coltman (36) and his dog Boozer decided to get some exercise and do a fast hike up Flat Top Mountain via the back side— not a standard route, but one Coltman had traveled many times before. Walking was easy because the snow was less than ankle deep most of the way and the tundra was blown bare in many places. The crux of the route is the last 100 meters to the ridge where the gully narrows and steepens through an S-shaped curve. The snow conditions as Coltman entered this segment around noon were different (i.e., more unstable) than any of the previous route. Within a few steps, the snow broke beneath him and sent him falling out of control down the gully.

On December 3, Andrew Morrison died when he fell several hundred feet from the South Face of Washington Column (Grade V, 11 pitches, 5.10a A2) in Yosemite Valley. On December 1, they climbed the three pitches to Dinner Ledge and slept on the ledge at the top of pitch 1. They admitted to being awed by the exposure. The climb starts from 3rd class ledges, yielding a few hundred feet of exposure on the first pitch—but they were all enthusiastic, enjoying the climb, and they felt the whole team was climbing competently and safely. Andy had done well leading the second pitch.

On December 12, a party of three had completed Selenium Falls, a water ice Grade 5 route. To descend, the climbers threaded their ropes through an existing Abalokov (V-thread) in the ice. A V-thread anchor is created by threading and unthreading two ice screws at an angle to one another through the ice and then threading a cord through the channel. A knot is tied on the outside to create a hanging loop. In this case, the cord had iced over since its original installation and the climbers mistook the long tail end of the cord for the main, knotted part of the loop. When the first climber, D.J. (40) began to rappel, the loose tail pulled out of the ice and he fell 140 meters to the base of the climb, sustaining fatal injuries. The other two climbers hiked up to the ridge and traversed over to the gondola station at the summit of the mountain. Two hours after the fall, they were able to alert Warden Service dispatch.

At this point, the story is a bit unclear, but witnesses say the victim was lower on the slope and stopped, perhaps stuck. He was off his machine in the avalanche released. The victim took off running as best he could in the deep snow, but did not get far when the avalanche plowed over him. After a few tumultuous seconds, the man found himself buried and stuck fast in the snow. In a Denver Post interview (Mar. 12, 2002, pages 1B and 3B), the man described his position, ""I could not move whatsoever. I was completely pinned down. I couldn't make a sound.

On Monday afternoon at Aspen Highlands Ski Area, a group of three snowboarders and one skier, all in their early to mid-20s, headed out through a Forest Service Backcountry Access Gate. The young men, all Aspen locals, were headed toward Maroon Bowl. At the gate, they were approached by a former avalanche technician/ski patroller who warned the group that they would likely trigger an avalanche, and with that avalanche came a real possibility of death. The group kept going and descended toward ""Jump Rock"" located low in the starting zone.

Two of the men jumped off the rock without incident. The third man off the rock triggered the avalanche when he landed. The fractures were not instantaneous; they propagated up and across the slope, almost in slow motion (relatively speaking). The three men took off down and across the slope, headed toward the south-facing terrain on the other side of the path.

On the afternoon of November 15, the two Golden men were climbing a steep, rocky gully on the south side of Quandary Peak. At 14,265 feet Quandary Peak is a popular ""14er"" for winter climbers and skiers. Located at the south end of the Tenmile Range, the summit is about 6.5 miles south-southwest of Breckenridge. One man carried skis on his back; his goal was to ski from the summit while his friend hiked down. The pair started their ascent at about 10:30 AM. About 1:30 PM, they triggered a slab avalanche that swept them off their feet.

The skier tumbled for about 200 feet before somehow stopping. At some point during his short tumble, he was knocked unconscious, and thinks he lost consciousness for about two hours. When he came to there was no sign of his friend. The skier removed his skis from his pack and used them to mark his position. Suffering bumps and bruises he started down the gully.

On January 7, H.C., S.P., and I headed into the hills south of Cache Creek for a day of ice climbing on “Oregon Jack.”
The ice was in good shape, although quite “platey” on the surface. The angle of the climb was moderate, so H.C. placed only four screws on the pitch, which looked like a reasonable number to us on the ground—although subsequent events were to prove this wrong. Just below the top, he placed his second tool, causing a large plate to fracture around both tools. H.C. fell a long way and came to rest upside down, unconscious, tangled in ropes and gear, and dribbling blood from out of his helmet.
S.P. was dragged out from behind the block where he was sheltering and was whipped over to the base of the route, but did a good job of maintaining control of the rope.

Analysis
His partner lowered the victim too quickly, and as a result, he caught his crampon on the ice causing him to spin and then stab his right knee with his left crampon. Belayers should always pay close attention to their partners while lowering, and the speed should be slow enough so the descending climber can safely negotiate the terrain s/he is being lowered over. Occasionally, a fast lower can result in the belayer completely losing control over the lower, resulting in serious injury or even death.

Each year there are at least a few reports of this kind of accident—both on rock and ice cliffs. The first order of business one should attend to for these top rope situations is setting up an anchor. Hard hats are a good idea for people at the bottom of the cliff or while climbing—to do the job they are made for, which is to protect one’s head from falling rocks or objects. In this particular case, a hard hat would not have done much good. (Source: Jed Williamson)","Serious, Head / Brain Injury, Unroped , No Helmet, Inadequate Protection / Pulled",,

They discovered fresh avalanche debris in Stairs Gulch and quickly found Martin Gleich’s boot sticking out of the snow about 100 yards above the toe of the debris. His head was buried about four feet deep. Medical examiners later determined he died by asphyxia.

On May 4, the “Joyful Expedition,” led by Chun Byung-Tai, was flown to basecamp on the Southeast Fork of the Kahiltna Glacier by Hudson Air Service. The eight man Korean expedition began their ascent of the West Buttress route on Mount McKinley on the same day and made their first camp at the 7,800-foot level. Continuing up the route the team arrived at the 14,200- foot camp on May 8. On May 9 two members, Kgyoung-Su Han and Chi- Hyeon Pack, began suffering from acute mountain sickness (AMS) with symptoms including nausea, headaches, and lassitude. Accompanied by one healthy teammate, Jinyong Kim, the sick climbers descended to camp one at the 7,800-foot level where they had an extra tent. Later in the day members of the expedition came to the National Park Service camp requesting that we look at Young-Tak Chin (23) who was feeling ill in their tent.

On May 6, a group of mountaineers were practicing crevasse rescue at Parker Ridge. The group was working in roped teams of three. A person on one end of the rope would jump off a corniced ridge, while the other two people on the rope would arrest the fall and then perform the “rescue”. A.L.’s group performed the rescue practice once successfully and then changed the order of the rope team to practice again. A.L. was facing away from the cornice when the person on the end of the rope jumped off. A.L. was spun around quickly and ended up with a spiral fracture in her lower leg. The rest of the group splinted her leg and then carried her out on a tarpaulin. (Source: A.L.)

This particular accident may have been prevented if A.L. had been facing the direction of the cornice and “victim”.

On May 14, Chi-Hyeon Pack (27) was evacuated by helicopter from Mount McKinley due to symptoms of a gastrointestinal bleed. A few hours later he underwent surgery for a bleeding ulcer at the Alaska Regional Hospital. (See the May 4 report.)
Analysis
Upon investigation it was discovered that Mr. Pack had a history of GI bleeds. Many of his symptoms were consistent with AMS, so it is understandable that the climbers expected him to recover after rest at lower altitude. Given his prior medical history it was unfortunate that Mr. Pack did not recognize his symptoms for what they were when they did not resolve at lower altitude. The other team members in the Joyful Expedition were willing to evacuate Mr.
Pack, but due to the possible severity of his internal bleeding, it was decided to evacuate him by helicopter.","Serious, Alpine/Mountaineering, Non-Ascent Illness",1.0,

On May 14, Brian Smudz and Yanchun Su climbed from the ground to Dolt Tower, without fixing any part of the route. They had planned on one relaxed day on the climb, and they took it on the 15th because of the long first day.

At 1430 on May 17, Frainciso Borja (32), a member of the Blue Skies Expedition, was witnessed by NPS Ranger Scott Metcalfe and VIP Kirk Mauthner falling from just below the balcony at 15,200 feet. Borja caught his right crampon on his left pant leg, falling approximately 30 feet where he self-arrested and came to a stop just above Mauthner and Metcalfe. Borja complained of a broken or sprained right ankle. After a patient assessment, it was determined by Bob Mayer, a VIP nurse, that Borja had point tenderness to his left hip also. At 1630, Borja was packaged and lowered to a sled at around 14,300 feet, where Metcalfe with two tail-ropers skied the patient to the 14,200-foot medical camp.

The year 2001 was a low snow year, but we felt it was reasonable for the two of us to ascend the heavily crevassed Athabasca Glacier since we had been there several times before without incident. The weather was poor on that early Friday morning, but visibility was sufficient to find a route up the glacier beneath Mount Snowdome. Trail breaking was hard with 30 centimeters of new snow, and the howling wind didn’t help as we lugged our 60-pound packs up the glacier.
We reached the serac zone beneath Mount Snowdome at about 1000 hours. On our left was a thick maze of crevasses. On our right were the house-sized blocks of ice from the seracs high above.

About 2100 on May 18, climbers at the 14,200-foot camp witnessed Ron Morrow (51) take a fall on the fixed lines around 16,000 feet. Morrow made it back to the 14,200-foot basecamp by 2300 cold and tired. His partner Michael Rodriguez reported that Morrow was so exhausted that he fell asleep until around 0700 the next morning. On the morning of May 19 Rodriguez helped Morrow to the NPS medical tent where it was determined by NPS personnel George Rodway and nurse Bob Mayer that Morrow had mild frostbite on his left little finger and fall thickness frostbite on the four largest toes of his right foot. Since the foot of Morrow had thawed partially overnight, Rodway and Mayer helped to thaw his foot completely with a warm water lavage. After his foot was thawed, he was unable to walk.

On May 19, Michael Thurgood (24), Alex Santy (17), and BJ Huff (19), were climbing Pentapitch, a 5.8 route on the south side of Little Cottonwood Canyon. Michael led the second pitch, belayed by Alex. As he approached the end of the pitch, the rope drag became difficult and he decided to down-climb a few feet to his last piece, a cam, to add a runner. While down-climbing, his feet slipped and he fell, pulling the cam and a nut. He fell 35-40 feet, ending up three feet below his belayer when his fall was finally stopped by his next piece —a sling on a tree.

On May 21, while ascending the Avalanche Gulch route, a large rock slide occurred, hitting a party of one guide and four clients. Two clients were injured.
The Sierra Wilderness Seminar (SWS) guided groups began their climb early to lessen their exposure to rock fall, which is usually more active in the afternoon. There were several SWS parties on the route simultaneously. One party was at 11,500 feet at 0745 when the rock slide started. As rocks and ice chunks fell, they attempted to move out of the way, but the rocks were moving fast and had enough momentum to cross the gulch where the party was located.

Heinrichs was leading the first pitch of what he thought was the South Ridge of Nez Perce, but in fact he was east of the normal route. He was trying to place his first piece of protection about thirty feet above the talus. His belayer, using an ATC, wasn’t anchored as he sat on a ledge about fifteen feet beneath the leader.

While crossing the north couloir of Milk Creek on July 1, two climbers (both 32) were ascending out of the bottom of the couloir on firm snow. One was crossing the bottom of the couloir when a rock struck him in the forehead.
The evening before the climb, while filtering water from Milk Creek, they did not hear any rockfall. They began their climb at 0230 to avoid rockfall and benefit from firm snow conditions. When they approached the couloir shortly before 0300, the snow was firm enough for them to use crampons. They stopped to put on crampons and to rope up. Still, no rockfall was heard. At 0310, a rock was heard rolling down the couloir. In the darkness, it was impossible to see the rock, but T.E. heard it strike P.D. and turned to see P.D.’s headlamp flying down the couloir.
A climbing group of ten came to the aid of these two and called for help. P.D. was evacuated by a National Guard helicopter about seven hours after the accident. He ","Serious, Head / Brain Injury, Alpine/Mountaineering, Visibility, Natural Rockfall, Late in Day",11.0,

On July 7, Christopher Ekstrom (22) was leading the first pitch of Lyon’s Chair in the Morning Glory Wall area of Smith Rock State Park. Lyon’s Chair is a three star route rated 5.11a and requiring gear to 3.5 inches according to Alan Watts’ Climber's Guide to Smith Rocks. “The start of the initial pitch makes a popular 5.10c stemming jaunt” according to Alan. Christopher was about eight inches from the first bolt anchors when he came off the rock, falling 15 to 20 feet and twisting his ankle.
His friends continued to climb for a while and then assisted him down the path toward their car, a half mile distant. They were met at the Crooked River bridge by a State Park Ranger who drove Chris up the steep hill to the parking area. X-rays taken the next day showed a broken tibia, requiring a cast for seven weeks. He made a full recovery.

On July 7, I (25) took S.P. (22), my girlfriend of a year, for a day of instructional rock climbing and rappelling. I have been rock climbing for four years and mountaineering on a half-dozen Cascade volcanoes. She had no experience doing either. S.P. is about 25 pounds lighter than I am.
After getting into harnesses, establishing an anchor, and setting a top rope, I began instruction on rappelling. Fifteen minutes later we successfully rappelled the 30 feet, and spirits were high. I was to climb first, and she was going to watch and belay me. As she was lighter, I tied her into a large, solid, dead log at the base of the climb, with webbing that ran four feet or so to her. She was using a figure-8 as a base-plate to belay from her harness. We established signals, and I began to climb.
About 20 feet up, while talking to her, I lost my handhold and began to fall. S.P. was at this point only two or three feet from the log, and the weight of my fall pulled the rest of","No/Little, Minor, Roped, Trad Climbing, Handhold/Foothold Broke, Belay Error",,

On July 10, three people, including Matt Gorman, were climbing the North Sister. The terrain became more technical than Mr. Gorman’s climbing com-
panions were comfortable with, so they proceeded back down the route of ascent. Mr. Gorman elected to continue to the summit alone. While on the west face of the mountain in one of several large, exposed, and unstable gullies, a large (500-800 pound) boulder slid out from under him. He said he then “rode” the rock a short distance before he was ejected off it and went end over end several times. He came to rest in a gully several hundred feet below the summit. His two friends heard him yelling for help and called 911 via cell phone.

On July 18, Ryan Sasser (27) and I, Holly Beck (26), got a late start out of our Moraine Camp on the Grand Teton due to an early morning rainstorm. Hiking up to the Lower Saddle, we reached the base of the Petzoldt Ridge around 8:00 a.m. We topped out on the Petzoldt Ridge before noon and continued to the Upper Exum Ridge to complete our route. We had climbed the entire Petzoldt Ridge in coats and gloves, and by the time we started up the Exum Ridge, we were climbing in intermittent snow and rain. At the bottom of the Windtunnel pitch we had to hide out for about twenty minutes while a brief hailstorm beat down. We finally summited just after 3:00 p.m. We had seen parties on the Upper Exum that day, so we were surprised to have the summit to ourselves.

They were at 11,800 feet, and he was aware of the rockfall, having asked the clients to move out of its fall line when he was hit. As he lay unconscious, one of the clients used his radio to call other SMG guides who were at a higher elevation.

On July 19, “Dan” (25), and “Jim” decided to beat the heat in the Salt Lake valley by climbing in cool, shady, Ferguson Canyon. Dan scrambled around to set up a top-rope on Mission Impossible, a 5.9 crack on the Cathedral. He clipped quickdraws to the two bolts at the top. Then, concerned about rope drag on the rock edge, he extended the anchor with a single piece of tied webbing. It was a long way from the bolts to the edge, and he had only one long sling, so he did not back up his anchor. He threaded a figure-eight device onto the ropes and started to rappel. Shortly after he backed over the edge, the knot in the webbing failed, and he fell 50 feet to the ground.
Dan was conscious and alert but suffering from two open lower leg fractures and a fractured wrist. He was immobilized in a bean-bag vacuum splint and carried out to the Ferguson Canyon trailhead, where he was loaded on a Lifeflight helicopter and flown to the hospital.

About four feet above the piece, he tested a large rock feature about the size of a basketball. He grabbed the feature with both hands and it pulled loose when he weighted it. He hit the belay ledge with his left foot and butt as the rope came tight. He stopped on the eight-foot wide ledge. His partner, Tim McMahill and three of their companions climbing with them on a separate rope, helped Ben rappel the steep places and lower him down less-steep places.

While signs and symptoms of AMS are not unusual in the Tetons, it is rare to see HAPE or HACE. During the summer of 2001, four significant altitude- related cases were seen. One was a 14 year old boy scout from Sugar City, ID, who had climbed the Middle and South Tetons from the South Fork of Cascade Canyon on July 24. At 1900, Ranger Jim Springer encountered the group at their campsite in the South Fork. The scout was complaining of headache, nausea, ataxia, and chest pain. Springer was able to hear gurgling in the boy’s chest and surmised that it was HAPE. Springer hiked the boy to lower elevation, and his condition improved as they got lower. They spent the night at the patrol cabin at 8,500 feet, and the gurgling was absent at that elevation....

On August 11 about 1100, Bev Boynton (51) and David Moore of Jackson, WY, were finishing the final pitch on the South Buttress of Jackson Peak in the Wind River Range of Wyoming. While Boynton was leading at about 12,800 feet, she pulled off a large flake of rock which caused her to fall about fifteen feet onto the ledge below. She sustained multiple injuries and believed that she had a pneumothorax. Moore gave her warm clothes and went for assistance. When he arrived at Indian Basin, he located campers with a cell phone and called the Jenny Lake Ranger Station in Grand Teton National Park. When the Sublette County Sheriff’s Office was notified, they requested the park rangers assist in the rescue.
Two park rangers and a Physician’s Assistant were flown to Moore’s location in Indian Basin. Helicopter short-haul technique was then used to insert rescuers to the accident site.

On August 16, “Jim” (28) and “Kirk” (32) set up a sport-rappel at a small crag in Millcreek Canyon. They used an old cotton rope from Kirk’s toolbox and tied off natural features at the top of the crag for an anchor. About halfway down, Jim bounced hard during his rappel and the rope broke. He fell about 20 feet, crashing through a small tree on the way and glancing off his partner at the base of the crag. Kirk was able to grab him at that point and stop him from tumbling farther down the slope.
Jim was secured in a bean-bag vacuum splint and lowered two pitches down steep scree to the Millcreek road. He is lucky to have escaped with only a broken ankle, abrasions, and lacerations.

On August 29, two climbers ascended Mount Sir Douglas via the East Ridge, alpine grade III, 5.6. Before beginning the route, they had decided they would descend the same way, instead of taking the longer but easier west ridge descent route. The climbers summited at a late hour, and decided to descend the west ridge after all. They bivouacked at a notch between the ridge and the glacier below and then attempted to descend the glacier the following day. The glacier was bare ice and steep enough to demand crampons, which the climbers did not have. They used their radio to call for a rescue. (Source: Kananaskis Country Alpine Specialists)

On September 2, Ron Lantham (37) and friends were climbing Zoo View, (5.8) a popular climb on Sentinel Buttress. After completing the first pitch, Lantham, the leader, constructed a belay anchor under a large roof. He placed the belay anchor low and redirected the rope through a single piece placed overhead. His second fell, causing the upper placement to take the force of the fall, causing it to pull out. The resulting shock-load caused the belayer to lose control of the belay and drop the second.
The victim remained dangling on the rope for several hours after falling approximately 50 feet. Stokes County Mountain Rescue lowered the climber to the base of the wall around 7:30 p.m. The climber was airlifted to Baptist Hospital in Winston-Salem. He had a fractured ankle and possible internal injuries.

Rescuers reached two seriously injured climbers on Mount Baker and were bringing them down the mountain in difficult weather conditions Monday morning.
The drama began on Sunday, September 2, about 11:30 a.m. when one climber was killed and three others were injured after falling into a crevasse. The fall happened at the 8,600-foot-level of Coleman Glacier on the western flank of the 10,775-foot peak.
Whatcom County Search and Rescue crews and personnel aboard a helicopter from the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station located the group Sunday, but the chopper was unable to land because of the high altitude. A 42-year-old man with minor injuries was able to get off the mountain, and ground crews reached the two more seriously injured people on Monday, sheriff’s deputies said.

Ken was traversing across moss-covered wet rocks above the 300-foot cliff when he apparently tripped or slipped about 30 feet from the edge of the cliff. His friend was ahead when he saw Ken fall and try to grab some scrub alpine trees, but his fall and acceleration were so quick that he was unable to stop himself from going over the edge of the cliff. Rescuers later found Ken’s hat at the location where he fell some 30 feet above the cliff. The body was recovered by helicopter the next day.
Analysis
In one 50-meter section, the normal scramble/descent route drops down the north side of the ridge, to avoid a steep, exposed section of rock. Ken fell to the south side of the ridge, from approximately the location of this steep area. He appears to h","Deadly, Unroped , Solo, Alpine/Mountaineering, Off-route",135.0,

On October 17, Brent Bishop (19) and his friend Jason (19) were scrambling the fourth class route to the top of the Misery Ridge Mesa at Smith Rock State Park when Brent pulled loose a hand hold near the top of the climb. He fell about 40 feet, breaking his leg and cutting his scalp. 911 was quickly called. Redmond Fire and Rescue assisted by Deschutes County Search and Rescue approached from the Crooked River below the Gully and performed a high angle rope and stretcher rescue descent to a wheeled stretcher and a waiting ambulance. Analysis
Brent, who has been bouldering for a while, says he wants to learn to climb with ropes. He says he has more respect for fourth class climbing following his accident.
This is one of several scrambling accidents at Smith Rock. The volcanic scree and friable rock in various locations in the State Park contribute to many calls for assistance from Park Rangers and Rescue units.

On December 8 about 1000, Aaron Shupp (22) fell 20 to 30 feet while leading the Main Falls Route (I WI4) at Hidden Falls. Shupp said that he was about 10 feet beyond his last ice screw when he began to “sketch out.” He attempted to place protection but could not hang on. Shupp ran out of strength and purposely submitted to a leader fall, alerting his belayer that he was coming off. As he fell, Shupp left both hand tools and a glove dangling from his last position on the ice. Shupp caught a mushroom of ice with his right crampon and heard a loud “crack.” He then impacted on the midway ledge of the water ice formation and was stopped by his previous ice screw. Shupp’s belayer, Seth Ian Friedly (age unknown), lowered Shupp to the base of the climb, where they determined that Shupp was unable to walk.

The Mount Shasta area had a late winter start with very dry conditions on the mountain. The ridge routes, which are popular at this time of the year, were in poor shape, with loose rock and icy patches.
At approximately 1300 on December 29, a solo climber on the Sargents Ridge route came across a climber who had fallen from approximately 12,500 feet on Sargents Ridge to 11,900 feet in Avalanche Gulch. The injured climber, Tom Malzbender (41), had separated from his partner and was alone at the time of the fall. Due to the rocky conditions, he was not wearing crampons and had tried to traverse an icy area where he slipped and tumbled down into Avalanche Gulch. He came to a stop on a 36 degree scree slope.

Ice on the first pitch of the popular 160-foot climb “Positive Thinking” broke off Poke-O-Moonshine Friday and crashed to the ground, taking an Ontario climber with it.
Kevin Bailey (34) was about 135 feet up and anchoring himself to the east side of the mountain when the ice split and detached. His climbing partner, Jason Kuruc, also of Ontario, stood below with the belay device, waiting to begin his assent.

Nathan Sanborn (27) was climbing the first pitch of Spiderman, a four star classic climb rated 5.7 by Alan Watts (trad gear to three inches) when he slipped off about three feet above his last protection and fell an estimated 12 to 15 feet due to rope stretch and an inadvertent dynamic belay. The toe of one foot struck a bulge on the low-angled rock, hyper-extending his foot and breaking a bone in his ankle. Additional tissue damage was done as well, and the injury was very painful.
Nathan was lowered off about 50 feet and the party called 911 for assistance. Redmond Fire and Rescue arrived in about one hour and Deschutes County Sheriff’s SAR somewhat later. Nathan was lowered down the scree in a belayed stokes litter, carried to the trailhead and transported to hospital.

In October, the climb up our twelfth 14,000-foot peak, Split Mountain, did not go well. One member of our climbing party, Dave French, was hospitalized for frostbite afterward and is still recovering.
It was early October. Dave, his son Sean, Sean’s friend Matt, their college professor Tom Campbell and I were expecting late summer conditions with fair weather and little wind. We did not realize however, that a storm earlier in the week had left seven to ten inches of snow above 9,000 feet, or that cold temperatures since then had left the snow as a dry powder. We were surprised to see the snow on the mountains when we arrived but we felt that it would probably burn off before we reached it and that any remaining would not be a significant factor anyway.

John Ohlson (61) was leading Pic O’ the Vic (WI 4) in the Ouray Ice Park. He led up to a stance at a cave—about 20 feet up, and placed an ice screw. He then continued up the next section, which was nearly vertical. About 20 feet above his screw placement, he came off. He essentially landed at the base of the climb. The rope did not come taut until the very end of his fall, and likely provided minor deceleration at most.
John sustained compression fractures to the T12 vertebra, a broken right thumb, and lacerations to his hands and face. Various others treated him at the scene. At first he thought he could walk out, but concern for the severity of his injuries prompted rescue personnel to raise him from the canyon bottom by winch on a litter with a body splint.

On March 11, while leading the first pitch of Lady Killer (II W13), A.M. fell after placing three screws on the first half and then running it out to the top. He fell to the ground and sustained pelvic and spinal injuries. Volunteer SAR groups from Golden responded by ground and treated the patient. Since the injuries were severe and lowering the patient problematic, assistance was requested from the Warden Service of the National Parks nearby. The patient was evacuated to an ambulance below by Heli-sling by Warden Service rescue crews.

Even on easier angled ice, topping out on a pitch can have disastrous results if no protection is available. In this case, the climber pulled out both his tools and was severely injured.

At 1700 on April 26, Alpine Ascents guide Brian McCullough (42) was traveling with three clients on an unnamed glacier in the Talkeetna Mountains when he broke through a snow bridge and fell fifty feet into a crevasse. McCullough landed at the bottom of the crevasse on his left side, his sled was caught by the rope and stopped just above him. Within minutes of the fall one of the clients approached the crevasse and determined that McCullough could ascend the rope. The clients then constructed an anchor and McCullough began ascending the rope. As McCullough approached the top, it was determined that a separate line would be necessary, as the original line had cut into the lip of the crevasse in the fall. Another anchor was constructed, and McCullough was able to ascend out of the crevasse on a separate line. After removing the rest of McCullough’s equipment that had been tied to the initial fall rope, the group decided to camp for the night.

On June 8,1 (Tim Derouin) was climbing up Avalanche Gulch on Mount Shasta with Mike Chase and his brother Steve. The weather over the past few days had been quite unsettled and very windy. The previous day almost no one made it to the summit because of the high winds. The weather was getting better, but it was still windy. We left Horse Camp (7,800 feet) at about midnight and reached Helen Lake at about 4:00 a.m. We continued on and were on schedule when I was hit by a falling rock at about 5:00 a.m. at 11,2000 foot elevation. This is above Helen Lake but below the prominent rock formation known as The Heart. The rock must have dislodged from above us and bounded down the steep (25 degrees) snow slope.

One of the rappellers, Jacob (20), who was relatively inexperienced, was being belayed from the top of the climb on a separate line by a friend, who was using a figure 8 on his harness. The belayer was positioned between the cliff edge and the rappel anchor, but was not tied in to the anchor and did not have a helmet or shoes on.

The snow and ice slope is 45 degrees at its steepest. In order to facilitate the descent for such a large group, the party fixed their climbing ropes with screw-anchors every 50 meters. The last climber would down-climb and pull the ropes and anchors as he descended. The lowest climber was waiting at a two-screw anchor when an avalanche released from above.

On September 23 about 5:30 a.m., a rock struck and killed noted double amputee climber Ed Hommer. Mr. Hommer and three companions were climbing the Disappointment Cleaver route in preparation for an attempt next year on Mount Everest.
The team of four climbers spent the night at Camp Muir and started their climb at 1:30 a.m. The climb proceeded normally and the team took a rest break at Ingraham Flats (11,000 ft.). The route from the Ingraham Flats ascends another 300 feet then traverses right onto the “Nose” of Disappointment Cleaver, a prominent rock feature that separates the Ingraham and the Emmons Glaciers. Later in the climbing season, Disappointment Cleaver is mostly exposed, loose rock. Any remaining snowfields are hard and icy and have large sun cups that require slow careful climbing.

On September 28, a party of two was reported overdue from a climb on the previous day. A search by Warden Service rescue crews was initiated and the party was located on the rappels on the north side of The Finger (II 5.5). They had spent the night on a small ledge. Overnight temperatures were in the -5 to -10 degree C range. The helicopter toed into a nearby ridge and a rescuer was dropped off to make voice contact with the party. They requested assistance. A party was inserted by heli-sling onto the summit and the climbers were raised back to the top. They were then evacuated by heli-sling from the summit.
Analysis
Although it is likely that the climbers could have continued the rappels down to the notch below, they were unaware that the third-class slabs below were covered in snow from early season snowfalls. It would have been very difficult to negotiate this terrain safely.

On September 30, the famed Swedish adventurer Goran Kropp died from a fall while rock climbing. He was leading Air Guitar, a 65-foot 5.10a crack that requires precise nut and cam placements. Kropp was near the top of the route when he fell some 60 feet to a rock ledge. Though wearing a helmet, he sustained fatal head injuries.
During the morning and early afternoon of that day, Kropp and his partner took turns leading sport routes. After climbing four or five bolted aretes, Kropp took advantage of an opportunity to toprope a crack, Pony Keg (5.10a). Although Kropp looked solid in the crack, he told his partner that he found the climb challenging. Kropp then decided to lead Air Guitar.
Kropp started up the route, placing, in order, a small nut, two microcams and three small to medium cams. He fell near the top of the climb— the crux, shortly after placing a three-inch cam.

On October 13, Kelly Elverum (34) was being lowered down Darkness ’til Dawn (5.9+) when the end of the climbing rope slipped through the belay device because the rope was not long enough to reach to the ground. The fall was about 35 feet, and the climber sustained serious head injuries. Neither climber was wearing a helmet.
Analysis
One way to prevent this from happening if one is not sure as to whether the rope will be long enough is to secure the end of the rope at the belay stance.
Leo Paik has this to say: As far as I know, there has never been an accident on Darkness ’til Dawn before. Myself, for Darkness, I usually take two ropes (which works well for protecting the traverse moves into the corner low down). The one-rope descent is to rappel/lower carefully to very close to the end of the rope, then scramble down 25 feet or so on steep third-class rock.

I’ve climbed the route lord knows how many times… I was working a ‘rope-gun’ day (meaning nothing but single pitch 5.10 and 5.11 lines) with one of my regulars. …I made poor decisions: no helmet (thankfully not a major factor) and I chose a tiny blue alien rather than a larger yellow one with a nut back-up as my first piece. When the unlikely fall happened, my gear was simply inadequate. As a guide, it’s all too easy to slip into thinking of the gear as only being there as directionals for the clients’ protection.”  (Sources: Hank Alicandri -Director of Land Stewardship/Head Ranger, and Mike Cimino.)","Experienced, Roped, Trad Climbing, Inadequate Protection / Pulled, grade:5.10",,

At about 1100 hours Sunday morning, two backcountry skiers were caught in a sizable hard slab avalanche in Herman Gulch, near Loveland Pass. One man was buried and seriously injured.

ACCIDENT
A party of 5 experienced backcountry skiers (4 men and 1 woman) equipped with transceivers and shovels followed Herman Creek trail northwest to the base of an avalanche path named Herman A. Leaving the trail, at least one member of the group heard a ""whumph"" sound, but the others did not. They climbed the west side of ""Herman A"" by switchbacking in and near the trees. They were climbing through over 3 feet of faceted sugar-like snow with various sun crusts.

Once above the trees, rather than traveling in an organized, single track, the party spread out. Two of the skiers were about 10 feet apart on a slightly lower-angled bench and were crossing the gully when the slab fractured above them.

Just before noon, the season's first fatal avalanche occurred about 6 miles east-southeast of the town of Breckenridge. The victim, a 39-year-old Lakewood man, was snowmobiling with his brother and a friend when he triggered a sizable avalanche on the east side of Point 12,201. This sub-peak is the high point of Mt. Guyot's north flank. (On March 18, 2002, a close call occurred in the same general area.)

The three riders -- not a part of any commercial or guided tour -- started in Park County and rode north and over Georgia Pass into Summit County. They spent the morning riding in the Georgia Pass area. Late in the morning, the trio followed the trail past a cabin -- known by locals as the ""Avalanche Cabin"" where two other riders were staying.

At about 2:00 PM Friday, a hiker -- on snowshoes -- was caught and buried in a medium-sized slab avalanche near Winfield. The avalanche accident occurred in the northwest basin of Point 13,044, a subpeak to the northwest of Browns Peak. The area is about one mile northwest of the summit of Mt. Huron, a popular 14er.

ACCIDENT
On Friday morning (4/9), three friends set out from Winfield to look at some land in the large west-facing bowl between Browns Peak and Mount Huron. The trio talked about climbing a peak on the way but decided to stay down low -- ""around treeline"" -- because of the avalanche danger. One man had checked our (CAIC) web page on Thursday and read our concern about the Front Range and Sawatch Ranges and about the potential of deeper-slab releases on the northerly aspects.

The avalanche hit the other two climbers, partially burying one and breaking all but their back-up anchor. The party had planned to climb Stairway to Heaven, but changed routes because they felt the avalanche danger on Stairway was too high.

This incident involved a climbing team that was part of a Portland-area climbing club. The following description of the events leading to the incident on January 11 and 12 was derived from an explanation provided by the climbing team.
Our intent was to climb the Leuthold Couloir. When we started up the Palmer Snowfield there were a couple of mild snow flurries and it was partly cloudy at Illumination Saddle. The weather cleared and was great as we traversed over to the start of the Leuthold climb. Around 9,800 feet we mistakenly took a gully to the right of the Leuthold Couloir that put us on the Reid Headwall. The weather conditions were still good at this time. Although I did not record times as to where we were, we seemed to be making good progress during this part of the climb. Once inside the gully on Reid Headwall poor snow conditions slowed climbing. We ran into loose, sugary snow conditions in steep areas that required belays.

R.C. was about halfway up a pitch that he was leading and had stopped to place his first screw. His tools pulled out and he fell down to the base of the pitch and broke both of his ankles. Part of the team descended to the Icefields Parkway where they flagged down a passing Parks vehicle and reported the accident. A warden rescue team heli-slung into the site, splinted both ankles, and R.C. was heli-slung out to a waiting ambulance.

After making NPS personnel in Talkeetna aware of the situation, rangers at the 14,200-foot camp mobilized available resources and devised a strategy to respond to Team Homer Company’s location.
Around 0300 a team consisting of NPS patrol members and emergency hired independent climbers left for their suspected location. Shortly there after as daylight allowed they were spotted by rangers and subsequently met by the ground team that had departed the 14,200-foot camp.
After being accompanied back, the climbers were evaluated by NPS medical personnel and it was determined that one of th","Serious, Alpine/Mountaineering, Ascent Illness, Exposure",1.0,

On May 17, Jacqueline Weimer (27) sustained fatal injuries after falling approximately 100 meters while rappelling adjacent to the popular El Cracko Diablo climbing route on Devils Tower.
Weimer and her climbing partner had just completed the Soler (5.9) and rejoined three friends in the Meadows, a large ledge system high on the south face of Devils Tower. The group of five decided to rappel together and rigged a double-rope rappel through fixed anchors using 60 meter ropes. A newer, smaller-diameter rope was threaded through the anchors and tied to an older, larger-diameter rope using a Flemish bend. The first person to rappel descended 59 meters—past two sets of intermediate anchors—to a narrow ledge with anchors. Using a different rope, he rigged a single-rope rappel at these anchors and continued down the remaining ten meters to a large ledge.

At 1825 on May 19, Christopher Allewell (age unknown) was assisted into the 14,200-foot NPS medical tent by his teammates. His chief complaint was severe abdominal pain and a mild headache. Upon examination, pain was localized in his mid quadrant, bilaterally, with a severity of ten on a scale of one to ten, ten being the most painful. Pain was not associated with vomiting or fever. However, Allewell expressed extreme tenderness and guarding of his abdomen. Symptoms occurred suddenly and had been apparent for approximately six prior to his arrival at the NPS medical tent. Past medical history did not indicate a cause. Bowel sounds were present and urination was clear. Allewell's pain was mildly relieved when he lay in a left lateral recumbent position.

On May 21, Chris Hampson (28) and Sibylle Hechtel (52) teamed up to climb Overhang Bypass on Lower Cathedral Rock. The route is approximately six pitches, originally rated 5.6 but considered more difficult since a large block fell from the crux a number of years ago, creating a mandatory 5.8/5.9 mantle. Their plan was to climb the route and top-rope Overhang Overpass, a 5.11 crack accessible from the upper section of Overhang Bypass.
Both Chris and Sibylle had climbed extensively in Yosemite, Chris having spent the last month climbing fall time in the Valley, and Sibylle having decades of Yosemite experience under her belt. This was their second route together, and it was well within their abilities.
Chris led the first pitch up easy climbing without placing any protection. Sibylle led the second pitch, to the base of the Hog Trough.

This summary is comprised of two separate incidents that ended up as one continuous effort using many shared resources and with multiple overlapping responsibilities.
On May 26 Lee Jung Park (age unknown) of the “Duksung Women’s University Alpine Team Expedition” injured her ankle when her leg “gave out” while descending the West Buttress route on Mt.

On May 27, Todd Passey (age unknown), a guide for Alpine Ascents International, was diagnosed with High Altitude Pulmonary Edema. Passey was put on oxygen, given Nifedpine and remained under observation overnight. On May 28, Passey, (along with Park) was evacuated by the NPS contract Lama helicopter to the 7,200-foot camp where he was transferred to a fixed-wing aircraft and transported to Talkeetna.

As for the HAPE case, everyone has the potential to be afflicted—even guides. Early recognition and descent are the keys to survival. Oxygen therapy will buy the patient time, but the best and most effective treatment is always to descend to a lower elevation. The patient’s team was initially planning on descending on the morning of the 28th, but with the Lama coming in to evacuate Park, it was determined that fewer people would be put at risk if Passey were evacuated.

On May 30, the two members of the Sled Dog expedition, Matt Sachs (34) and June Braugham (40) were evacuated from the 14,200-foot camp on Denali. On the 29th, Sachs sustained a knee injury while climbing to the fixed lines and requested ranger assistance to descend. Sachs was lowered approximately 1,200 feet by NPS personnel to the 14,200-foot Ranger Camp where he received medical assistance for the night. Sachs was flown to 7,000-foot camp the following morning by the Denali Lama helicopter. Due to her very limited mountain experience, Braugham accompanied Sachs to Denali basecamp after it was deemed unsafe for her to continue climbing on the mountain.

On Saturday, May 31, a first-season leader and his partner were starting up Roadside Attraction, 5.9+ on Saco Crag, north of Cathedral Ledge. The leader used a nut as his first piece to protect the opening crux moves and had fallen onto the gear several times. The belayer was securely anchored to a large tree at the base of the route, situated over a steep and exposed slab that drops off to the base of the cliff. A nearby climber saw the falls and advised the leader that his nut placement had shifted and he should put in a multi-directional cam to protect the crux. The leader was satisfied with the gear he had and made another attempt to climb, but this time his fall pulled the nut out. Apparently he fell onto his back and slid approximately 15 feet down the slab, where his belayer caught him.

On June 1, Peter Staples (48) of the “OSAT,03” expedition, suffered from High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) while camping at the 17,200-foot camp on Mt. McKinley’s West Buttress route. Staples was assisted by his team and National Park Service (NPS) Ranger Gordy Kito and NPS Volunteer In Park (VIP) Ryan Davis from the 17,200-foot camp to the 14,200-foot Ranger camp, where he was monitored and released. Staples was able to continue with his team down to the 7,200-foot Kahiltna base camp under his own power and without further incident.
Analysis
The amount of time that the “OSAT,03” expedition took to get to high camp was within the timeframe recommended by the NPS. Mr. Staples may have been able to increase his chances of acclimatizing well by taking even more time getting to the 17,200-foot camp.

On the afternoon of June 2, an RMI guided group was ascending below the fixed lines around 15,000 feet when assistant guide Ryan Sorsdahl (24) twisted awkwardly and felt something “pop” in his lower back. Keil Hillman, lead guide, assessed him and concluded that he could not continue up. He contacted the 14,200-foot Ranger Camp and informed Ranger Evans of this via CB radio. As Sorsdahl could move under his own power without a load on his back, it was decided to send up VIP Dave Hanning to assist Sorsdahl down. As the location was considered to be in a safe area, Hanning ascended by himself, then carried Sorsdahl's backpack down while escorting him.
At the Ranger Camp Sorsdahl was examined by Medic Michael Dong, who diagnosed the damage to the soft tissue of the sacroiliac area involving the sciatic nerve.

Aaron stopped halfway up the second pitch, established an anchor, and brought up Mark and Chad. The anchor was built from his own gear, so he was reluctant to leave it behind when they descended. He spotted a cluster of slings about 25 feet further up the pitch and climbed up to a small ledge just below them, for a look.

On July 26 at 1535, lightning struck and fatally injured Erica Summers (27) while climbing the Exum Ridge of the Grand Teton. This single lightning strike traveled down the Exum Ridge injuring seven climbers, five seriously. The initial 911 cell phone call at 1546 reported that CPR was in progress, one climber was hanging unresponsive from a rope, multiple people were injured and at least three climbers were unaccounted for.
The response to this incident included two Type-3 interagency contract helicopters with two full helitack crews, one air ambulance, three ground ambulances, and almost all members of the Jenny Lake Sub-District staff. Rangers flown into the Lower Saddle climbed or were short-hauled to two accident scenes. Rangers worked diligently in steep technical terrain to evacuate all the seriously injured patients and the fatality before nightfall.

They got to the base at 7:00 a.m. to allow plenty of time for the route, but a party of four was already there. Waiting for the larger party to clear the second pitch cost the Popkins 45 minutes, and then another hour on the third. The party of four ultimately pulled ahead, but the Popkins then lost more time allowing a faster party to pass. Randy and Cameron were having no problems with the technical difficulty of the climb, but they were getting a lesson in the realities of a long and popular route.
Finally, high on the face, where the route traverses to the right to the final fourth-class pitches, they missed the turn and continued straight up.

Knowing how critical water would be, we each had three quarts readily available for the first day, and five additional gallons per person, packed away in our two haul bags, for the next six days (3.3 quarts per person per day). In addition to what we figured was an ample supply of water, we were also prepared for fall storms, had a bolt kit, and, in short, were ready for any contingency—or so we thought.
Our goal for the 22nd was to climb three pitches and sleep at our high point, but it was very hot, and we moved more slowly than planned. We managed to finish our ","No/Little, Minor, Roped, Trad Climbing, Aid & Big Wall, Poor Cond/Seasonal Risk, Severe Weather, Inadequate Food/Water, grade:5.8",,

On November 11, a party of ice climbers on the route R & D on Mount Murray in the Ranger Creek area, was hit by a size 1 to 1.5 avalanche before beginning the climb. One of the party had fallen after the avalanche had come to rest, breaking a bone in his left lower leg. A second size 1 to 1.5 avalanche struck the group as they moved towards safer ground.
Analysis
The local guidebook indicates that Ranger Creek is home to some of the earliest-formed ice. The area should, however, be avoided after heavy snow due to the surrounding avalanche terrain. On November 11, snow continued to fall heavily at the rate of one to two centimeters per hour during the course of the rescue and the roads were in poor condition. A ground evacuation was required. The terrain above the area was reloading, placing the party and all rescuers at risk during the 1.5 hour rescue.

No accident occurred, no one was caught, but a bit of an incident ensued, and there are some important lessons to be learned by all. One of the skiers involved has posted a summary of events along with a sincere apology on the Teton Gravity forum (http://www.tetongravity.com/forums/showthread.php?t=28239).

At about 10:30 am May 20, a 53-year-old male skier from Boulder was buried and killed in a medium-sized wet slab avalanche at Arapahoe Basin. The avalanche occurred in an area known as the First Alley, immediately below the roll on the west side of the Pallavicini Run. This is the fifth Colorado avalanche death of the 2004-05 season and the 27th in the US.

RESCUE
The Arapahoe Basin Ski Patrol responded immediately and were soon joined by members of the Summit County Rescue Group. A portion of the victim's ski boot was spotted at the surface. A Flight For Life helicopter flew the man to a hospital, but he could not be resuscitated after a burial of about 31 minutes.
The search effort was suspended at 12:45 (Summit Daily News) because of the threat of additional wet snow avalanches caused by the high temperatures. By late afternoon, no other skiers or riders had been reported missing. Search efforts resumed the following day.

In June, Kevin Smith (32) was rappelling with a partner on Capitol Peak, a 14,000 foot peak with a Grade IV 5.9 North Face route and a classic “knife- edged” hiking route about 14 miles west of Aspen, when his anchor gave way and left him stranded as a result of his climbing rope falling with the anchor. He was about 80 feet off the ground.
Smith’s climbing partner, Doug Shepherd (23), was not able to reach with a rope and left for help at about 1:30 a.m. Shepherd had to hike about eight miles in the dark. The sheriff’s office did not receive information on Smith’s whereabouts until 8:55 a.m.

Late Sunday morning, a backcountry snowboarder -- a Denver man and a long-time rider in the Berthoud Pass area -- and his dog were buried and killed in a sizable hard slab avalanche on the north side of Mines Peak, just northeast of the summit of Berthoud Pass. This was the first Colorado and US avalanche fatality of the season.

ACCIDENT
On Sunday morning, three snowboarders set out from the summit of Berthoud Pass looking for powder. They climbed to the east and then traversed northward to the shallow bowl on the north side of Mines Peak (Mines Peak 1). Above treeline, they stepped into their boards. The first rider cut under the big wind-roll of drifted snow and rode to the trees just above where the gully starts. The second rider started down, followed by his dog, and was in the middle of the slope when the snow shattered like a pane of glass. In an instant, he was tumbled and swept away. The slide had broken out at the feet of the third rider. The time was about 10:30 AM. ","buried:1, killed:1",,

At about 1230 hours Thursday afternoon, two teenage hikers were caught in a hard slab avalanche on the east side of Kelso Mountain, a little over 3 miles south of Bakerville and about 1 mile east of the summit of Torreys Peak. One young man, an 18-year-old from Colorado Springs, was buried and killed.

ACCIDENT
On Wednesday, the two teenagers (ages 18 and 17) had set out from Bakerville with aspirations to climb the Kelso Ridge (aka East Ridge) of Torreys Peak. The pair snowshoed up Stevens Gulch following the summer trail to the start of the route. The pair camped Wednesday night near the bottom of the climb. Strong winds racked the mountains and caused heavy blowing snow. By Thursday morning, the winds only grew stronger. With ferocious weather, the boys reconsidered their plans and opted for retreat. The pair packed up and started back down the summer trail.

A party of four, Dr. Jim Sprott, Niles Woods, Martina Volfova and Kneeland Taylor, flew into the Ruth Glacier on April 19 with Talkeetna Air Taxi. On the 20th the group climbed Mount Dickey and on the 22nd they attempted a different route on Mount Barrille but turned around due to poor snow conditions. Also on the 22nd Taylor flew out of the range leaving a party of three. Two inches of snow fell on Thursday night. Due to weather conditions, the group got a late start on Friday for their attempt on the Japanese Couloir on Barrille.

Analysis
Spontaneous rockfall and hold failure is common in this area because of the nature of the rock in combination with the winter melt and freeze conditions. This is evident in the large scree slopes below the crag. For that reason it is imperative that climbers be alert for rockfall and holds be tested before fully weighting them.","Serious, Natural Rockfall, Ledge Fall",44.0,

On April 26, an experienced climber (44) had led Yin Yang (5.10d) and set up a top-rope for his partner (26) to follow. The leader had used long cordelettes to extend the anchor because the climb was about 120 feet and their rope was only 200 feet. With the rope doubled, the leader was lowered safely to the ground because the anchor was extended. His partner top-roped the climb and disassembled the anchor. She threaded the rope through the anchor chain and her partner began to lower her. Her plan was to get to the end of the rope and swing over to another climb and down-climb a crack
to the ground, a distance of about 15 feet. She was cleaning gear (stoppers) from the climb as she was being lowered. After she had done the retrievals from the crack, her partner began to lower her. As he did, the end of the rope fed through his belay device (an ATC), thereby resulting in a 20-foot fall to the ground. No serious injury resulted.

They spent the day talking about descent, but decided to reevaluate their plan at the base of Liberty Ridge. On the fourth day, June 16, an apprehensive Penn decided to start up the ridge with Hancock setting anchors and belaying every pitch. It took 14 hours for the pair to reach Thumb Rock. Both individuals were exhausted and dehydrated when they finally arrived.
Penn knew that it should only take four to six hours to reach Thumb Rock from lower Curtis Ridge. He was surprised that other climbing parties were not placing protection and climbing the lower ridge without belay. He then realized that their climbing method was not practical for the route.

On June 16, Doug Grennan (18) and eight friends were top-roping sport climbs in the upper S-Curves area of Big Cottonwood Canyon. Doug was climbing a 5.10 route on the right side of the buttress, most likely Urban Sprawl (10a). When Doug reached the chains, he clipped in and cleaned the draws, as no one else planned to climb the route. He untied, threaded the rope through the chains, and tied back in. At this point he was still on belay, but with lots of slack in the rope. His plan was to have his belayer lower him. Because of an overhang below him, he and the belayer had a hard time seeing or hearing each other. Doug leaned out for a better look and yelled, “Take.”
As he did, his feet slipped and he fell 60 feet to the ground, with the rope running through the belay device. He suffered a fractured sacrum, and bruised heels and sternum.

He was then lowered on that anchor by his belayer. While he was still 25 feet above the ground, the belayer lost control when the end of the rope ran through his belay device. The leader was dropped and sustained numerous injuries, including a serious head injury.

The leader survived with a severe head injury. The two climbers reportedly had recently met and were doing their first climb together. The climbers underestimated the length of the climb and over estimated the length of their rope.

Analysis
The Cascade Volcanoes are notorious for rotten rock. Climbers usually only climb the steeper technical routes when the freezing level is low and the rock is secured by layers of rime ice. Generally speaking, by early July, most of the ice on the upper mountain has melted away, significantly increasing the risk of rockfall. Additionally, the bergshrund crevasses on the south side of Mount Hood have usually grown to the point that the are a much more formidable hazard then they are during the “normal” climbing season (May-June.)

Dufay assisted Fry onto a narrow shelf in the crevasse and made him as comfortable as possible before seeking help. Dufay unroped and descended the route and through the ice chute back towards Camp Hazard. In the ice chute above Camp Hazard, Dufay met an RMI guide, Lyndon Mallory, who radioed the NPS for help.

Near 11,700 feet, the team entered a large cavernous crevasse close to the Disappointment Cleaver. They traversed some 7 5 yards into the crevasse and found an exit ramp out the other side. While ascending the 35-40 degree exit ramp, the snow slope fractured and slid.
The slab was estimated to be about eight to 14 inches thick and ran roughly 150 feet. The avalanche swept both climbers back into the crevasse.

A father and son team attempted to climb Torreys from the top of Loveland Pass via Grizzly Peak. They probably decided to turn back at some point while on Grizzly. From the ridge above the Grizzly 1 (also known as the Ironing Board), they thought it would be quicker to glissade down to the highway and get a ride back to the top of Loveland Pass than to retrace their steps. They started on separate routes down from the ridge and found that they were postholing rather than glissading. The son dropped in behind the father to be in his father's track. The son said he was about 100 feet behind the father when the slide went. They were both caught and tumbled 200 vertical feet down the slope.

On May 14, two male climbers (38 and 26) got lost while climbing the South Ridge of Mount Edith (2,554 meters) just west of Banff. They did not have very good information on the location of the descent route, although they had read about the route itself in a local alpine climbing guide. They began to rappel before reaching the summit, but ended up getting stranded above steep overhanging terrain on the Southwest Face. They were able to call for help on a cell phone.

On May 15, Christopher Simmons (26) and Emily Craft (28) became benighted on the eleventh pitch of the North East Buttress route on Higher Cathedral Rock. They were rescued by park personnel, who went to the summit and lowered fifty feet to the climbers, providing them with dry clothing and then hauled them to the summit. They walked down.
Analysis
Simmons is 5.12 sport and 5.10 trad leader. Emily leads 5.11 sport, but had done no trad leads. This was their first long route. It has lots of chimneys but they had never climbed chimneys before this. They had left headlamps behind, had insufficient clothes, only one rope, and made a late start. The top pitch is confusing and they got lost at dark. They tried to find a way out and finally called for help by cell phone.

We departed the Pole Creek Trailhead, 5,200 feet, at 1:00 a.m. on May 22 with the intent to climb North Sister via the Early Morning Couloir in a day. We arrived at 8,500 feet below the Northeast Face in four hours, five miles from the trailhead. We took a long1½ hour break to evaluate the atmospheric conditions as we had experienced intermittent precipitation and variable cloud cover on the approach. The clouds showed no signs of building.
At 6:45 a.m. we departed and climbed the Northeast Ridge separating the Early Morning Couloir and the Villard Glacier routes gaining the North Ridge by 9:00 a.m. Of particular interest was the change in snow conditions; a good bucket step was typical on the east side. However, we found a solid but breakable crust on the west-facing slopes. We summited at 10:15 a.m. Conditions were still variable with the cloud cover decreasing and the ambient air temperature increasing.

On May 24, Eric Gurvin (19) sustained injuries to his back, ankles, and wrist when he fell 20 to 30 feet when the person lowering him ran out of rope and dropped him.
He had finished climbing a 5.9 route in Boulder Canyon known as Animation and was being lowered to the ground from a top rope about 4:00 p.m. There was another climber with them.
Analysis
As he was being lowered, Gurvin’s belayer was unaware that the end of the rope was approaching and allowed it to slip through the belay device used to slow the descent.
This cliff has a number of routes longer than 30 meters per pitch. Thus, it sets up folks who climb with 60-meter ropes to need a second rope. Many sport climbers these days do not bring a second rope.

At 1600 on May 27, both members of a Spanish expedition “Dos Perdigones en la Cassin” began their ascent of the Upper West Rib. As the team approached the summit around 0500 the following morning, they recorded winds of 30 mph and a temperature of -40F. Adraino Martin (31) took off his glove-shells and, wearing only mid-weight liners, took photographs for several minutes.

Sanders was climbing the Pseudo Weissner route with a friend and a professional guide when the accident occurred. She was preparing to climb the third pitch of the route and was attached to a set of anchor bolts when a 10- to 12-inch diameter rock was dislodged by a party climbing approximately 300 feet above her. The rock struck her in the helmet, left arm and left ankle, causing multiple injuries, including several broken bones. Sander’s guide provided initial care and was lowered with Sanders 200 feet to the base of the route by another climbing party. Rangers and other climbers then packaged and lowered her in a litter through another 100 feet of vertical terrain.

On July 5, John Hrizo (36) was injured in a lead fall of about thirty feet on the second pitch of Northwest Books on Lembert Dome (5.6, 3 pitches).
According to Hrizo, he did all the leading, followed by his partner, Stacy Waksmonski (29). After they climbed the first pitch, Hrizo climbed to an intermediate belay midway through the second pitch where he rigged a belay. Because Waksmonski was a relatively inexperienced climber, Hrizo wanted to break the pitch into smaller pieces for her.
After belaying Waksmonski up, Hrizo began to lead the second half of the pitch. He had with him a copy of the Supertopo Guide to Tuolumne Meadows, and from it he concluded that the right-curving crack above and to the left of the belay was 5.9, harder climbing than he intended to do. Hrizo placed a #3.5 Camalot just above the belay and began to climb the face to the right of the crack.
Initially, the face climbing was easy, around 5.6. But as he climbed higher, ","No/Little, Serious, Roped, Trad Climbing, Pendulum, Off-route, grade:5.6",,

On July 7 at 0720, John Lucia (31), a guide with Rainier Mountaineering Incorporated (RMI), was leading a rope team up the Ingraham Glacier around 12,800 feet when one of the clients, Peter Bridgewater (54) fell on the icy slope. Lucia successfully arrested the client’s fall and then attempted to place a picket for a running belay. After that, Lucia’s memory becomes fuzzy, but he does recall wanting to put Bridgewater on a “short tie-in” as he was concerned about Bridgewater’s footing. During this time, Bridgewater somewhat regained his footing and starting crawling towards Lucia. As he ascended, slack was created in the rope; moments later Bridgewater fell again and pulled Lucia off his feet. Lucia described being unable to self-arrest due to the momentum and the hard ice. The other two clients, Matt Fisher (42) and Patrick Clements (36), also attempted to self-arrest, but were subsequently pulled off as Bridgewater and Lucia slid by.

On July 10, a six-person team set out to climb Sharkfin Tower in North Cascades National Park. After a glacier crossing, the group passed the standard gully used to access the objective, the southeast ridge of the peak, and ascended a similar, but farther gully. Realizing this, the group began a traverse in two rope teams of three, employing belays, to get back into position for the ridge climb. During this movement, rockfall struck one member, causing injuries to her face, eye, jaw, and one hand, but left her ambulatory with assistance. The group decided that rescue assistance would be necessary for evacuation of their injured member but planned to first retreat back down the gully they had ascended as a group to the top of the glacier. During this time the weather, which had been good at the start of the day, began deteriorating.
The group faced a descent of approximately 300 to 400 feet down a gully of mixed snow and rock.

On July 12 at 1545, four members of a seven-person Mountaineers group, Chris Clapton, Rebekah Koch, Theresa Fielding, and Tom Labrie, were descending the Emmons on one rope when Koch caught a crampon on some rope slack and tripped at 13,500 feet. Her fall pulled Fielding and LaBrie off their feet, and the three began to tumble down the 40 degree icy slope. Clapton went into self arrest and caught the fall, preventing a much more significant accident from occurring.
Labrie broke his nose and injured his leg during the fall. Fielding severely sprained her ankle. Clapton and Koch secured the team with an anchor.

On July 15, at 4:30 p.m. I (Jeff Moore, 27) was injured when I dislodged a large rock while climbing a short Class 3-4 chimney on Tuolumne Peak in Yosemite National Park. I was climbing alone collecting data for a research project on exploring rockfall. I had not informed anyone of my itinerary, carried no cell phone, and was not wearing a helmet.
The research project had taken me to nearly the same spot the previous Monday to determine rates of cliff erosion by rockfall. On this Friday I had completed 2 sites and was heading for a third at a large cirque amphitheatre on the southeast flank of Tuolumne Peak near Tuolumne Meadows.
Approaching the site, I was stemming an inside corner when I grabbed a hold above my head and dislodged a large rock. The rock was about twice the size of my chest and it came free from the wall easily, causing me to fall about 15 feet in an upright position.

On July 18, Dave Ireland (51) and Peter Uzieblo were about two pitches up Lions Way (5.6, six pitches) on Eastpost Spire. One dropped his digital camera, and so they were rappelling to retrieve it. Uzieblo did a mix of down-climbing and rappelling in order to lessen the weight on the rope. He then yelled up to Dave Ireland not to pull out on the anchor, only down. Unfortunately, the anchor failed Dave Ireland about a full rope length (60 meters) to the boulder field below, resulting in fatal injuries. In meeting with the Invermere, B.C., Coroner the day following this tragic accident, she advised that D.I. died instantly of a broken neck.
Peter Uzieblo is an accomplished and experienced climber. Dave Ireland was a novice with top-rope experience in Devil’s Lake State Park (WI), but he could easily follow on 5.8 routes.

Kate Tinnesand (23), a graduate student at Oregon State University and member of Corvallis Mountain Rescue Unit, died in a fall while descending Three Fingered Jack, on July 23, after a climb with two other Unit members. They had completed the “technical” part of the climb, had unroped, and were working their way down the south ridge when Kate slipped on a gravel-covered ledge and tumbled over 700 feet on the west side of the mountain, sustaining fatal injuries.
Comment
She had been coming to CMRU meetings and training sessions since January and had just completed the interview process in June to become a fall member. Kate enjoyed the outdoors including climbing the Cascade peaks in Oregon and Washington. Kate was finishing a Masters in microbiology and had aspiration to work as a climbing ranger in the parks.

On July 24, after a successful climb, our party of three was on the last (sizeable but sloping) ledge and final rappel of the route. I (Scott McGee, 39) was struck on the front half of my helmet by a bread-loaf-sized rock traveling at high velocity. I lost sensation and movement in my hands and feet, fell to my knees, and began to tumble backwards. (I experienced no loss of consciousness.) The first partner, who had just clipped in to rappel, arrested me by the harness and leg.
The second partner, a ski patroller, and I assessed potential injuries, ruling out destabilizing neck fracture and head injury. Normal sensation returned to feet and legs, but burning sensation persisted in hands. We elected to self-evacuate, stabilizing my neck, rappelling two short sections, and short roping to trail.

Banff rescuers Marc Ledwidge and Gord Irwin were slung to the scene by helicopter and were able to free the man after more than half an hour of tricky maneuvering. They brought kitchen oil from the CMH Lodge to lubricate the man’s leg. “We put a rope raising system on him and tensioned him up, trying to figure out which way to move him to get his knee unstuck,” said Ledwidge. “So with the combination of the tension system and just trying to move him back and forth a little bit, and the oil, we eventually got him free.” (Source: Cathy Ellis, Rocky Mountain Outlook)","Serious, Roped, Trad Climbing, Stranded / Lost / Overdue, grade:5.6",,

She and her partner walked to Camp Muir and contacted the guide service who then contacted the Park Service.
As there was a language barrier preventing good initial communication, the mechanism of injury became the deciding factor in evacuating Fernandez by air.

On August 1, Sandy Edmiston (22) fell 60 feet to her death from the anchors of a bolted sport climb at the popular Rodeo Wall, south of Jackson. A novice climber, Sandy had learned to clean bolted anchors earlier that afternoon. On two climbs prior to the accident, she had safely cleaned and lowered off with step-by-step instruction. On the day’s final climb, she struggled to negotiate the crux and reached the top of the climb after sunset, though still before dark. Believing that Sandy had demonstrated an understanding of how to clean an anchor safely, her partner did not talk her through the process a third time. This time, Sandy neglected to pass the rope back through the rappel rings after cleaning the draws from the anchor. Believing that she was on belay, she asked for slack so as to be able to unclip from the anchors, and when she did so, fell to the ground. She suffered severe head trauma and died on the scene.

The man was about 20 feet from the ground and about to clip his first ice screw when he fell, resulting in a broken ankle. He was rescued from the site by helicopter.
This isn’t the first rescue performed at popular Haffner Creek, which is an easily accessed canyon off the Highway 93 South with a multitude of single pitch ice and mixed climbs. “With respect to that spot, a lot of people go there to practice,” she said. “It’s really well known. Everybody’s really careful there but it’s still been a few broken ankles pulled out of there.”
While they were waiting to chopper out the patient, another climber took a four-meter fall and decked. Fortunately he managed to get up, dust off, and walk away. (Source: Edited","Serious, Roped, Ice Climbing",,

On December 4, a climber was traversing into the center of Odell Gully with his two partners. They were about a third of the way across the neck of the gully when a gust blew the lead climber off his feet and spun him, causing him to strike his face on the ice. He slid 400 feet down-slope on windslab and boilerplate and did not self-arrest because of being in a state of shock from the blow he experienced. He slid into rocks and stopped. His partners down-climbed to him, tied him in, and lowered him to more moderate terrain. One of his partners then went to call for help from Harvard cabin.

The climbers were unroped but were planning on roping up when they reached technical terrain. The avalanche conditions were posted as “considerable” at the time.

West Virginia State Police say Amanda Joy Crawford was climbing a “via ferrata” (iron way) at the Nelson Rocks Preserve in Pendleton County when she unhooked one of her lines to go around a tree, mis-stepped, and fell almost 150 feet. She was pronounced dead at the scene.
The type of mountain climbing Crawford was doing is rare in the United States. It’s a system that is said to be safe for people who have no prior climbing training. We spoke with an Eastern Mennonite University professor who is familiar with via ferratas. He says this type of climbing is designed to prevent any accidents.

The first two skiers could see the toe of the avalanche and rushed over. On the way, they triggered a much smaller avalanche. The party began a beacon search and found Skier 3 in several minutes. Skier 3 was buried deeply, and the party estimated it took eight minutes to dig 6 to 7 feet down and reach his face. Skier 3's face was blue. Once the party cleared snow from his mouth and nose, Skier 3 began to breathe on his own. It took another 10 to 15 minutes to dig Skier 3 completely out of the snow.

There was a close call early this season. Two backcountry skiers were in the Jones Pass area. They had made several runs in an upper bowl near the pass. On their last run, they moved to a smaller untracked bowl. They found ""bomber hard"" snow and were unable to break through when they jumped on it. The first skier descended along the skier's left side (looker's right) and waited at the bottom of the slope just before the end of the snow. The second skier entered the slope further to the skier's right. The skier triggered an avalanche on his third turn. The fracture propagated very quickly across the slope. The skier was able to struggle to the skier's right of the avalanche, and was almost free of the tumbling debris. Another avalanche ripped out along the right flank, catching the skier again. The combined avalanches carried the skier 2/3 of the way down the slope, and, fortunately, he was deposited uninjured on the surface of the debris.

I am not a stupid man. Nor am I an inexperienced backcountry traveler.

I have spent the past twelve years skiing in Colorado's backcountry. By definition, the continental snowpack that exists here is full of weaknesses. Because we deal with such cold temperatures, moisture is often sucked out of the snowpack, leaving behind weakened crystals that cause avalanches.

Analysis
It would appear they didn’t know the rock well enough to understand that the best option here might be to rappel rather than lower. Another question is why they didn’t have two ropes. It seems that the new generation of climbers takes only one rope on multi-pitch climbs. Taking two ropes, even if the second one is only of small diameter, provides the opportunity to rappel. Whether lowering or rappelling, tying a knot in the end(s) of the rope is usually a good idea.

On January 21, a group of seven climbers from the Korean Alpine Club of Utah started an ascent of Mount Olympus from the Pete’s Rock trailhead. Their plan was to snowshoe to the South summit via the Tolcat Trail, then down-climb to the couloir between the two summits and descend the couloir back to the trail.
After summiting, the group began the down-climb to the couloir. This is a 50-70-degree snow climb, with areas of exposed rock and ice. The easiest route descends for about 300 feet and then traverses slightly West before continuing to the saddle between the summits. The climbers had removed their snowshoes and were down-climbing unroped and without crampons.
In Han (47) and Usun Park (63) descended first, missing the traverse and continuing lower in the fall line, where the slope angle gets steeper.

The climbers incorrectly equalized the ends of the rope for the rappel, causing one end to remain 30 feet off the ground, though the climbers did not notice it, as the slope of the climb hid the ground from view. Both began the rappel with the climber on the longer end of the rope going first. When Fitzgerald reached the end of the rope 30 feet above the ground, he began to fall toward the ground, causing the rope to slide through the anchor and Victor Guzik to fall ten feet.

On July 13 a climber (37) took a 100-foot fall on the Red Garden wall in Eldorado Springs before his partner managed to control the rope, stopping his partner’s descent about ten feet above a rock ledge. The climber suffered minor head injuries and cuts, Boulder County sheriff’s deputies said. He was taken to Boulder Community Hospital.
His climbing partner, Nick Saylor (19), said the man was an experienced climber who slipped after getting off route. Saylor, whose hands were bandaged by rescuers on scene, said he was climbing above his partner and it took him several seconds to stop the rope.
“The rope just went right through my hands,” Saylor said. “I guess you can see the bones.” Saylor was able to lower his friend to the ledge and yell for help until someone called 911. It took rescuers an hour and 10 minutes to get the climber safely to the ground. (Source: From various postings at the website http://mountainproject.com)

On August 4, I.C. (41) and B.B. (36) set out to climb the standard route on Mount Church (12,200 feet) in the Lost River Range.
The approach to Mount Church begins with a strenuous 1.5 miles, one thousand foot climb through the forested bottom of the Jones Creek Canyon. The route then climbs a side canyon for fourteen hundred feet to a ridge which divides Jones Creek from an unnamed drainage to the west. The bottom is blocked repeatedly by the meandering Jones Creek, which zigzags back and forth leaving steeply cut banks, covered with tangled brush and downed timber. The approach route is so difficult that it takes most climbing groups more than two hours to reach the point where the route leaves the canyon bottom. On the day of the accident, there were no other climbers on the route.
About half way through the Jones Creek bottom, the climbers left the route and started to climb a steep side canyon.

On September 6, Ken Koski (56) fell to his death while either ascending or descending the Southeast Ridge of Mount Bonneville. He was in 4th and 5th class terrain.

An extensive and expensive search eventually discovered his body 4-500 feet below the ridge. His journal was a huge asset in this search. It described him slipping twice in 3rd class terrain in two days, which helped searchers focus their efforts on the area beneath the exposed ridge.

Analysis

Ken was climbing alone and unroped. None of the local guides knew of an unroped route up Mount Bonneville. But Ken’s journal mentioned a chimney he saw in a guide book that none of us are familiar with. This chimney is supposed to be key to sneaking up Mount Bonneville, and Ken’s journal indicated that he had found the chimney during his aborted attempt on September 4.

Climbing near Durango, I was on a route well within my ability and moved about eight feet above a piece of protection, which I knew was probably less than ideal. Thinking, “There’s no way I’ll fall on this,” I continued up. No sooner had I moved up and my left hand greased, followed by my left foot. I slid down the rock (it was just slightly less than vertical), the piece popped and I fell approx 25 feet. I hit a ledge, snapping my left foot. Luckily, I stopped on this ledge and didn’t continue to fall further.
I did have my helmet on and lucked out that I didn’t fall over backwards, causing worse injury. I suffered a compound fracture of the medial malleolus, severed a posterior vein and artery and a section of nerves on the medial side of my left foot as well as all of my tendons, ligaments, and cartilage on the medial aspect of my foot.

During the mid-day of July 12th, a team of three were climbing near the top of the Kain Face on Mount Robson. The climbing rope somehow wrapped itself around A.H.’s leg. He stumbled and consequently pulled his groin. The team lowered themselves down the face. The injured climber stayed at the Dome while his two partners descended to Berg Lake where the Robson Ranger Service was notified. The Jasper Warden Service was dispatched early the next morning with a helicopter to pick up the injured person.
Analysis
This incident had potential for much more serious injuries. It stresses the importance of vigilant rope management. Having a rope wrapped around one’s leg [while climbing] at any time is not advised. (Source: G. Lemke, Public Safety Warden).

On Sunday, September 16th at 6:00 p.m., Chris Stanko and Alex Mondau contacted a Park Ranger at Paradise and reported that their partner Phil Michael was overdue. The pair had just returned from Camp Muir earlier in the day. The party of three originally arrived at Camp Muir on September 14th. Michael and Mondau successfully climbed to the summit on the 15 th and returned to Camp Muir for the night. Michael was reportedly doing very well but took extra time visiting with climbers at Camp Muir. Stanko and Mondau told the ranger that they had separated from Michael at about 11:30 a.m. near Moon Rocks (8,900 feet) on the Muir Snowfield while descending in poor weather. So when Michael did not show up at Paradise by late in the day, Stanko and Mondau became concerned but were confident he’d come out on his own in the morning.

On July 28th, an RMI client (38) fell a short distance into a crevasse, sustaining a shoulder dislocation while descending the Disappointment Cleaver Route. The fall was apparently due to a bridge collapse or partial bridge collapse. The incident occurred on the Emmons Glacier close to where the Emmons and Ingraham glaciers diverge (12,300 feet) at approximately 12:15 p.m. The route the guide services were using had just recently changed course slightly; therefore, it was a new crossing.
Burdick was not hanging more than ten feet into the crevasse, and the guide service easily extracted him by hand. An RMI guide completed a patient assessment, and a posterior shoulder dislocation was the only injury found. Burdick was otherwise in good shape and had a positive attitude. The guide then notified other guides at Camp Muir of the situation. The guides at Camp Muir notified the climbing ranger at Camp Muir of the incident.

About 11:30 on 01/04, a snowboarder was caught and killed in a large avalanche between Vail Pass summit and East Vail. The path is known as CDC. The terrain was steep, 35-39 degrees, with an east to east-north-east aspect just at treeline. The large hard slab was 2 to 7 feet deep, 130 feet wide, and ran 800 vertical feet (HS-AR-R4D3-O/G).  The slide initiated on an old bed surface, but quickly ran to ground. The avalanche carried the boarder over at least one cliff band and into a group of small trees. The other two party members quickly found the boarder, but they needed a rescue group to transport the victim out of the complicated terrain. The victim was the only party member on the slope at the time. All three party members were carrying avalanche beacons, shovels, and probes.

""False stable"" conditions occur when you assess the snowpack as stable when it is actually unstable. The term often comes up when snowpack tests indicate stable conditions - ""strong test scores"" - but the slope avalanches. Researchers report false stable rates of around 10 to 15%, depending on the snowpack test used (Birkeland and Chabot 2006). The results often occur in a persistent weak layer.

On February 10, Sheila Matz (50+), RH (Bob), JU (Joanne), MG (Marilyn), PB (Phil), MG (Mike) and JS (Jim) met to climb at Red Rocks. The day was clear and sunny with a light breeze and temperatures in the mid-60’s. The Climbing experience of the group ranged from several years (Marilyn and Jim) to several decades (Bob and Joanne). Sheila, although having climbed for 10+ years, did not lead. Jim was a new leader. The group decided to go into the Solar Slab area of Oak Creek Canyon where multiple climbs of similar grades could be found.
Three teams were formed: Phil and Mike, Bob and Jim, and JU, SM, and MG. Hence, three different, three-pitch routes varying from 5.7 to 5.9 could be climbed. All of the routes ended on a large, football-field sized, low angle ledge below the Solar Slab itself, where options existed to either continue climbing higher on the slab or to descend down the gulley back to the base.

On Saturday February 18, a party of eight climbers departed Timberline lodge for a climb to Illumination Saddle (9,300-foot elevation) where they dug snow caves in preparation for a summit bid on Sunday.
The decision to abort the summit attempt was prompted by the scheduled arrival of a major storm system with high winds (gusts to 74 mph) and 30- foot visibility. At 0930 on Sunday, the group descended on two ropes, with climbers attached at 20-foot intervals, intending to intercept the middle of the Palmer ski lift and follow the lift down to the lodge. They wore crampons, used ski poles, and had a magnetic compass as well as a GPS receiver.
The apparent track of the party was north of the intended heading, and an hour and half after leaving the saddle, the lead climber of the first rope team fell over a “cliff,” pulling two other rope team members and his dog with him. The last climber was not clipped into the rope, but holding a rope loop instead, and so","Serious, Head / Brain Injury, Roped, Alpine/Mountaineering, Visibility, Severe Weather, Off-route, Large Group",3.0,530.0

On March 4, I was climbing a thin, dihedral crack with a bulge about 30 feet up. I had two nuts in below me as I approached the bulge. My belayer was sitting back from the base of the climb about 20 or so feet because the wall was at a lower angle for the first bit of the climb before the crux. The way the rope was running up to me as I climbed over the bulge made the stoppers turn perpendicular to the rock. When I fell, the protection ripped out fairly easily.
Analysis
The two biggest things I took away from my accident are 1) have sufficient gear for the climb and place it correctly; and 2) the climb will always be there. If you aren’t feeling strong or confident that day, there are always other climbs. (Source: From a report by the climber, Keo Boulton [18])

On Saturday March 17, M. McNeely (age unknown) and her husband David, both experienced climbers, were attempting Little Corner (5.6) a rock climb located on Shortoff Mountain at the south end of North Carolina’s rugged Linville Gorge Wilderness Area. It was late in the afternoon when Ms. McNeely started the climb, getting solid gear placements as she led the first pitch. She was well into the climb when her hand unexpectedly slipped out of a hand crack. She fell backwards approximately 15 feet striking her back on the rock. Her gear held, limiting her fall. Luckily, her head didn’t make contact with the rock, as she wasn’t wearing a helmet, which could have compounded her injuries.
David lowered her to the ground. Upon reaching the ground, she had no complaints or concerns about injury. At this point, the couple made plans to climb out, with David taking the lead.

He was wearing crampons at the time of the fall, but his ice ax was secured to his pack. He said he was not using it because by the time he realized he needed it, the terrain was too steep to take his pack off.

Frank was an experienced climber who frequently climbed in the park. According to park personnel, Frank had led the route and upon descent, had left his quick-draws in place. Ms. Nagem then attempted the climb clipping into the preset gear as she climbed. During a point in the climb, Nagen was just out of reach of the next protection point when she asked Frank for slack so she could clip into the next quick-draw. Frank complied, and it was at this point in the climb when Nagem slipped and fell approximately 20 feet, sustaining injuries to both her left leg and arm, and experienced tingling and numbness in those extremities.

The lead climber and belayer should always tie into opposite ends of the rope, or else a knot should be tied in the rope-end opposite the leader. In either case, the rope-end opposite to the leader would not then be subject to slipping through the belay device. Alternately, the leader could have rappelled—with knots in the ends of the rope, so he could not rappel off the ends. (Source: Steve Muelhauser, Park Ranger)

On May 20, professional guide Joe Owens (also a PMR team leader) encountered an injured climber at the 9,300-foot elevation being assisted by another guide. The unguided climber (age unknown) had caught his crampon on the snow crust while descending and badly twisted his ankle. The guides splinted the ankle, packaged the climber in a sleeping bag/tarp, and lowered him during deteriorating weather and visibility. The climber was transferred to a ski area snowcat. They also alerted the subject's two climbing partners, who were unaware of the injury.

Jack Ziegler (50) registered with the National Park Service as a member of a Rainier Mountaineering, Inc., guided expedition, with Greg Collins being the lead guide. The expedition flew onto the mountain via Hudson Air Service and proceeded up on a normal schedule. The expedition ultimately climbed to the 17,200-foot level, arriving there on June 29. Ziegler stated that while at 17,200 feet, he had a feeling of “unwellness.” He had experienced a bad headache but that had been relieved by Motrin. He also suffered a bout of nausea that was ameliorated by sitting up and breathing deeply. The lead guide ultimately decided to bring him down to the 14,200- foot camp for evaluation, and then planned on continuing to basecamp. While descending from 17,200 feet, Ziegler stated he felt very exhausted with a lack of energy and SOB (shortness of breath).

On July 3, rangers from Glacier National Park and wardens from Canada’s Banff National Park and Waterton Lakes National Park cooperated in the rescue of an injured climber. The climber, Denis Twohig (68) from White- fish, had taken a 15-foot pendulum fall while leading a technical rock climb on the “Gendarme” late on the afternoon of July 2nd. His climbing partner stopped Twohig’s fall.
The uninjured partner lowered Twohig a short distance to a ledge and secured him. He then left Twohig and descended Little Chief Mountain, reaching the Rising Sun Lodge store about 11:00 p.m. He reported the accident to Glacier dispatch. Recognizing the extreme technical nature of the incident and Twohig’s emergency medical needs, rangers held search and rescue planning sessions through the early morning hours to coordinate different rescue options.

On July 3, a climber fell near The Heart in Avalanche Gulch at 12,500 feet while descending and stuck his crampons into his calf, receiving multiple deep puncture wounds. A USFS Climbing Ranger at Helen Lake made contact with the climber at 1400. The climber refused assistance and descended on his own.
Analysis
An ice ax and crampons are great tools for snow and ice and recommended on all routes on Mount Shasta. However, we see puncture wounds every year due to improper use.

On July 15, two climbers (22 and 20) were attempting to climb the Prow on Washington Column. They decided to retreat from the wall after reaching the top of pitch six. After an attempt to rappel their route, the pair concluded that a retreat down the Prow would be too difficult due to its angled nature. They instead decided to rappel straight down onto what they believed to be the Ten Days After (TDA) route. Neither climber was familiar with the TDA route.
It is believed that the climbers committed to the TDA route at the top of pitch five. The climbers were apparently aware that the TDA route below their position was overhanging. They believed that the descent could be completed by tying their climbing ropes together and rappelling a single strand to a ledge system above the actual base of the wall, since they felt they would not be able to reach intermediary anchors due to the overhanging nature of the wall.

On July 29, a climber (45) caught a crampon tip while descending the standard Southside route, falling about 300 feet. He was unable self-arrest, but as his ice ax was attached to his wrist, it probably caused a shoulder dislocation during the attempt. He also suffered facial abrasions and a sore ankle. With assistance from his climbing partner, he was able to walk down to the Upper Palmer Lift Station where he was treated by an AMR RAT team and assisted down the lift. The subject was taken to a hospital by private auto.

On August 4, Daniel Filler (21) suffered a 15 to 20 foot ground-fall at Hellgate Cliffs in Little Cottonwood Canyon. He was climbing Dark Star (5.12a), a trad route on a crag otherwise fall of bolted climbs. He had placed three pieces when he fell. The third piece, a large nut, pulled when it was loaded. He hit the ground, landing on rocks and bushes.
Salt Lake County SAR and Unified Fire responded. They packaged Daniel in a litter and vacuum splint and lowered him down the scree slope to the trailhead. He was then transported by ambulance.

Hellgate Cliffs are a limestone outcrop in Little Cottonwood. This area is known for rockfall and pulled holds. It is likely that poor rock quality contributed to the failure of the nut placement.

Around 2 p.m. on August 7, two climbers (ages unknown) retreated from the Dunn-Westbay (V 5.10 C3). One of the duo was rappelling to Green Pillar Ledge, a bivy platform at the end of pitch-two, while the other climber waited at the anchors above him. Approximately 25 feet above the ledge, the rappel ropes snagged behind a flake, and above the rappeller. The rappeller pulled harder and harder to free the rope. He eventually succeeded, but the flake also tore loose and hit him on his helmet. Knocked unconscious, the climber plunged down the ropes and slammed onto Green Pillar Ledge, where he stopped—a miracle, as the ends of the ropes were not knotted.

On September 7, while ascending the standard Southside route, one climber (36) of a party of two lost his footing at about 11,000-foot elevation and fell about 100 feet. He was unroped, unable to self-arrest, and fell onto the lower lip of the bergschrund. He suffered abrasions, puncture wounds, and a twisted ankle.

Both climbers were treated and escorted down to an awaiting snowcat by a PMR/AMR rescue team.

Analysis

Late season climbs are usually more difficult technically, as the snow turns into ice and rockfall hazards become excessive. Under technical conditions the protection of a roped belay is recommended. To allow self-rescue, partners should stay in close contact with each other.

The use of a helmet may have prevented serious injuries. (Source:","Serious, Unroped , Solo, Alpine/Mountaineering, Poor Cond/Seasonal Risk, No Helmet, Party Separated",3.0,

On Sunday morning, November 4, Jim Anglin (55) was descending into the Lower Gorge by a Fourth Class climbers’ way at the southeast end of Smith Rock State Park when he lost his footing and fell about 100 feet to his death. No one saw him slip. Anglin and his climbing companions had been heading down into the Lower Gorge to climb traditional routes in that area of the Park.
Analysis
Jim Anglin had been rock climbing at the highest level at Smith Rock since the 1980’s, and is credited with many first ascents. Recently, he had participated in replacing anchors on routes on Monkey Face.
The Fourth Class Climber’s Way they used on Sunday descends into the Gorge from a section of the volcanic Rim Rock located behind the Park Offices.

We hadn’t climbed this peak before, but we’d researched the route thoroughly and knew it was well within our technical abilities. We also knew it was storm season, but the Thursday evening and Friday morning forecasts called for sunny on Saturday and mostly cloudy on Sunday, with no precipitation in sight.

On November 12, rangers and Fayette County Emergency Services personnel rescued a climber (age unknown) who had fallen at the Endless Wall climbing area. Rangers Randy Fisher and Karl Keach, working with only a general description of the location of the accident, received through a 911 call, searched for and found the caller, who led them to the scene. Keach coordinated the rescue from the top of the cliff while Fisher employed a series of ladders and ropes to reach the injured climber, who had suffered numerous fractures and lacerations. An 80-foot litter raise was conducted to bring him to the top of the cliff. He was then wheeled out on a litter and flown to the Charleston area trauma center.

On November 18, three adults acting as guides took six teenagers on a church youth group trip to Reimers Ranch, a central Texas limestone sport climbing area popular for its concentration of moderate climbs. The group leader, Kyle Focht, had six years of climbing experience and had taken groups on similar outings in the past. Official guides to the area are somewhat unusual, and youth groups led by an experienced leader are a common sight at the park. The group climbed at a popular beginner’s wall known as Dead Cat’s, a 35-foot cliff that is frequently climbed and typically crowded. Climbing at Reimers Ranch is done in a canyon along the Pedernales River. Trail access is a steep trail through a limestone creek bed.

At 0800 as many a three private parties and two guided groups headed out of camp for the summit.

Visibility and winds remained tolerable above Denali Pass (18,200 feet) for all teams to continue their summit push; however, below the pass conditions were much worse. By the time the descending climbers reached Denali Pass, the snow and wind had created a new 5-20cm windslab across the traversing slope that leads from Denali Pass back to High Camp. New snow and whiteout conditions almost completely obscured the poorly marked boot-trail back to camp. All of these factors considerably slowed the downward progress of all the descending teams.

Bear Creek is popular out-of-bounds terrain adjacent to Telluride Ski Area. The victim, on skis, was riding with a companion on a snowboard. The morning of the incident, the pair left the ski area and entered Bear Creek. They made a run on a slope locally known as E-Ticket/Needle's Eye area without incident. They returned to the ski area and ascended for a second lap. They noted many other backcountry travelers in the area. Telluride Ski Patrol estimated over 80 people skied in Bear Creek by noon on the 29th. To avoid desc","buried:1, killed:0",,

On May 9th, rescuers responded to a climbing accident near the Zion- Mount Carmel Tunnel. A 27-year-old man was on a route known as “Feast of Snakes,” which is located on the Pine Creek Canyon wall directly below the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel, when the fall occurred.
He had placed an anchor at the top of the route and was cleaning gear while being lowered by his partner, who was using a Grigri, at the bottom of the climb. The rope was too short for the slingshot belay technique and the end of the rope went through the Grigri, dropping the climber 20 feet onto his neck and back on a ledge below the route.
Due to the steep terrain and loose footing, along with the mechanism of injury, rescuers called for a helicopter to perform a winch extrication. The rescuers had to do a technical lowering first to move the climber from the ledge. An additional low-angle technical raising, followed by a low-angle lowering, were performed before carrying the patient to an open are","Serious, Descent, Roped, Trad Climbing, No Backup or End Knot, Lowering Error",233.0,125.0

On Tuesday, July 14, 2009, Samuel Wilson (18) and his friend (17), both from the state of Washington, called 911 at 6:30 p.m. They had been climbing routes all day at Smith Rock State Park and had become stranded about 100 feet below a popular feature known as Monkey Face and about 250 feet above an access trail.
Their rope had become stuck and they were exhausted and stranded on a ledge. Twenty-seven Members of the Deschutes County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue Unit assembled and set up a Command Post. Six members of the SAR Mountain Rescue Unit established a position in an area known as the “Springboard” and lowered a member of their Team to assess the young climbers’ situation on the ledge.
The two climbers were then attached to a rescue rope system and lowered approximately 250 feet to the trail below. The climbers were met at this location and treated at the scene.

A climber who witnessed the fall saw the woman bounce off the belay ledge and fall down a rock gully until bystanding climbers jumped on her rope and arrested the fall. She was lowered to the ground and received care until Rocky Mountain Rescue Group arrived. Apparently her belayer had not tied into or tied a knot into the end of the rope. After the woman led the climb and was being lowered, the rope end ran through the belay device, causing the fall. She fell between 10 and 30 feet and hit several ledges, sustaining injuries to her face, head, and right knee.

Concerned about becoming lunch herself, Janet jumared up an old fixed line to the top of the first pitch.

Another climbing legend passed on today. On June 24, Paul Duval (71) died of injuries sustained when he rappelled off the end of an un-equalized rope at Moonlight Ridge.

Paul was a very humble and gentle man. His contributions to rock climbing were numerous. We will miss him.

Analysis

Paul had set up a rappel using someone else’s rope that had multiple markings, including markings about 20 feet from each end. Paul was not familiar with this latest in rope-design. It appears that he short-roped one side due the selection of the wrong rope marking, which he apparently assumed was the middle mark. He had passed the first marking on the rope and then went all the way to the next mark, which was actually an end ‘alert’ mark, about 20 feet from the end of the rope. The center mark was faded and difficult to see. The short end of the rope was over a small overhang and Paul was facing in the opposite directi","Deadly, Descent, Roped, No Backup or End Knot, Rappel Error",,

Heerlein struck his head (some protection was provided by a bicycle helmet) and lost consciousness during the fall. He was transported to a local hospital by a Blackhawk helicopter.
Analysis
Although this route is often climbed unroped during normal conditions, the exposure provides ample opportunity for injury during a fall. The security provided by the rope should always be considered. The helmet likely minimized the head injury. Having an M.D. and paramedic in one’s party is always good fortune.

On July 13, Paul R. (47) fell 50 to 60 feet while climbing “49” at the Minimum Crag. His belayer was using an Edelrid Eddy. He was using a 9.2mm rope, which falls within the manufacturers recommended rope diameters. The belayer claims that the climber was clipping a draw when he fell; the climber claims he was not clipping a draw at the time of the fall. Irrelevant, but part of the situation. From what I have been able to surmise, the belayer felt the rope tug, depressed the device “trigger” and tossed out what he thought would be an armload of rope. This is why it resulted in a 50-foot fall.
Analysis
A review of the device description states, “The design makes it impossible to hold the cam open in this way—it’s simply not big enough to hold [during a fall].” The belayer states that he was not holding the climber side of the rope during the fall. By holding the climber side of the rope exiting the device, it would render the device useless. (Source: Fro","No/Little, Roped, Sport, Belay Error",271.0,

On August 9 about 1300, Chris Pazder (56) fell to his death while attempting to traverse from the South Teton to Cloudveil Dome. Pazder was in a climbing team of four who were traversing a snowfield on the south side of Gilkey Tower (about 12,320 feet), when the fall occurred. Pazder was the last climber in the party. When he slipped, he was unable to self-arrest, resulting in a fall of about 600-800 vertical feet. The climbing team was not roped at the time of the accident. All members were using an ice ax and wearing crampons.
A major SAR operation ensued, involving about twelve rangers and seven heli-tack crewmembers. An aerial reconnaissance helicopter flight was conducted with three rangers onboard to determine Pazder’s location. Pazder was found in Avalanche Canyon at 1430. The aircrew was able to determine that he had sustained significant injuries from his fall and was deceased.

On August 31, Tomoki Shibata (22) led Church Bowl Tree, a 5.10b crack, belayed by Hiroki Kishi. Shibata left his helmet at the base of the climb because the route was only one pitch long. From the ground up, in this order, he placed a camming device, another cam, a stopper, and a third cam. The stopper dislodged as he was climbing.
Details are sketchy, but when the stopper fell out, Shibata apparently realized that a single piece stood between him and the ground, and we think he decided to go for the bolt anchor several feet above. His feet were about 40 feet above the ground when his left hand-jam slipped out and he fell. His top piece pulled out under the force of the fall; he hit the ground on his feet and then tumbled over. The rope came tight just as he hit, absorbing some of the energy of the fall.

We’d been climbing pretty intensively for 3-4 years at a good standard, though no big walls. We had the idea we were going to do the Nose and the Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome on this trip. First we tried El Cap, sharing bivies and some gear with two other friends climbing as a separate party. When they decided to retreat, we forgot to have them leave the community poop tube behind. The next morning we rummaged through our haul bag looking for a substitute, but when we couldn’t find anything, we reluctantly bailed, too, and set our sights on Half Dome.
We planned to hike up Thursday afternoon, October 2, sleep at the base, and allow two fall days on the wall with a bivy on Big Sandy Ledge along the way.

Mamoyac started up the 12,277-foot mountain Sunday for a one-day climb. Family members reported him missing Monday when he failed to show up for work.
After a five-day search, he was located just below the 6,000-foot level. He was taken by helicopter to a hospital in Portland. He was listed in fair condition. In addition to his fractured ankle, he was dehydrated and had swollen legs. He told rescuers he ate centipedes and drank water from creeks as he tried to crawl to safety.

He had also exhibited fatigue on the day of his collapse and needed assistance with his backpack on the last hill that leads up toward Windy Corner.
Fatigue is common during these early carries. The distances are not great, but the amount food and gear that are required for 21 days on the mountain make the loads heavy.

Park dispatch received a cellphone call from climber Daniel Susman (20s) around 10 a.m. on July 15th, in which Susman reported that he’d become ledged-out while scrambling on a dome near Merced Lake and that he’d need assistance getting off the ledge. He said that he wasn’t in any immediate danger but that he was unable to ascend or descend from his location. Upon flying past, rescue personnel were shocked to discover that Susman had downplayed his predicament. They found that he was standing on minuscule ledge, clinging to the rock on a nearly vertical wall approximately 800 feet above the valley floor.
Susman’s position was deemed to be too tenuous to try to retrieve him directly by short haul. The concern was that the buffeting winds from the aircraft might dislodge Susman from his stance before he could be made secure.

Each team climbs as many difficult routes as possible in a day. Around 0845, competitors Guy Lacelle (54) and his partner Adam Knoff completed the ice climb The Dribbles and traversed into the gully leading up to The Climb, above The Dribbles. During this time, two other competitors were climbing The Dribbles with the same objective, although they approached it after climbing a separate set of nearby routes. At 0900, one of them triggered a small avalanche (six inches deep) that caught both him and his partner, carrying them approximately 300 feet down the gully and over a 2 5-foot ice step where they stopped. One of them ended up going over this precipice headfirst while the other cascaded over the cliff on his back. Both climbers were shaken up but unharmed. They continued back up the gully.

A mountaineer had fallen from somewhere between the top of the Fan and the ice bulge in Central Gully. He slid approximately 1,000 feet through icy talus before coming to rest near the base of Huntington Ravine. He suffered numerous significant injuries, including a mid-shaft femur fracture.

We were both cautious, yet eager climbers with moderate skill, decided to climb Mounty, a 5.7 trad route. The beta we had gotten from mountainproject.com had indicated that the pro was small but solid. Although I wasn’t a very experienced trad leader (I had only lead trad 8 or 9 times before this route), I was a confident 5.7 climber, so I wasn’t very worried about the small pro. We were on a ledge, so I built a belay anchor for Michelle before starting up. After 25 feet of climbing, I had only found placements for three small pieces: two nuts and a #1 (blue) mastercam. I clipped the rope through the carabiner attached directly to the mastercam’s integrated sling. At this point, I found that I had gotten a bit off-route and traversed a bit up and to the left to get back on to the main crack.

On the morning of June 5th at 0445, a large avalanche along the Ingraham Direct route was reported to NPS rangers by RMI guides on the Ingraham Glacier around 11,400 feet. Eleven people—a party of three Americans, a party of six Koreans, and two solo climbers, one of whom was a skier—were reported to have been involved in the avalanche. It was reported that five were still partially buried, five had been recovered, and one was still missing.
Rangers Glenn Kessler and Thomas Payne received the report at Camp Muir, whereupon Payne climbed to the scene while Kessler took the role of IC. When Ranger Payne arrived on scene, mountain guides and other members of the parties had recovered ten of the eleven involved climbers. Ranger Payne, along with guides from AAI, RMI, and IMG, assessed the injured climbers while plans were made for evacuation off the mountain.

On January 1, a group of climbers met at a popular ice climbing area in Waterton National Park. Upon arriving at the base of the climbs, it was discovered that another party had begun up the easier of the climbs, French Kiss. Of the group, only one felt confident enough to lead the harder climb, Quick & Dirty. The climber moved slowly and appeared to be having trouble placing an ice screw near the top where his protection was dangerously runout. He eventually fell a distance that landed him within a few metres of the bottom of the climb. It is estimated that the distance was between 40 and 50 feet. The climber landed upside down with the screw he was trying to place in one hand and one axe in the other. His helmet was cracked on one side.

On January 21, while ascending the Southside route on Mount Hood at 10,000 feet, a large piece of falling ice hit Brooke Colvin (31) in the face, causing her to fall about 400 feet. Her climbing partner (and husband) descended to her, realized that she was deceased, and continued down to report the accident. A separate party witnessed it and notified authorities by cellphone. A rescue team from Portland Mountain Rescue lowered the body to an awaiting snowcat at the upper Palmer snowfield.
Analysis
The unstable ice near the summit was caused by an unusual early season temperature inversion. The summit ice (heavy rime-ice) becomes a greater risk when warmer temperatures melt the bond holding the rime in place. This is normally due to direct solar heating (greater later in the day and later in the season), but can also result from prolonged elevated air temperatures.

Fellow climbers and rescue crews evacuated an injured climber on January 25 at the Tennessee Wall after she took a serious leader fall.
Jesse (22) was leading Blood on the Rocks (5.10b/c) in the north section of T-Wall. Witnesses said three or four pieces of gear pulled when she fell, causing her to fall to the ground—about 30-3 5 feet. The route is an 85-foot, single-pitch.
She had previously fallen on a BD C3 #1 and it held fine. She attempted the move again and fell, this time with devastating results when the cams pulled out of the crack.

During the afternoon on February 7, a climber (21) fell over 50 feet sustaining serious life-threatening injuries. He had just climbed the popular route Potholes, a moderate 5.8 route up the steep east face of Red Twin Spire in the Gateway area. The 55-foot-high route, protected by four fixed pitons and bolts, works up a series of potholes to an airy exit and a small summit the size of a dining room table. At the edge of the summit is an anchor composed of fixed pitons linked together with chain for top-roping, lowering, and rappelling.
The climber apparently untied, threaded his rope through a large quick- link on the chains, and prepared to rappel with a figure-8 descender. He failed, however, to thread both sides of his rope through the descender and locking carabiner, instead just securing one side in the device. So when he stood up and weighted the rope, it zipped through the quick-link and dropped him down the vertical face to a concre","Serious, Descent, Roped, Sport, Knot & Tie-in Error, Rappel Error, grade:5.8",,

A climber rappelled off the end of his rope on February 17. He explained that he was in a rush. He set up an anchor, clipped the rope to the middle mark, threw the rope, started rapping, and suddenly found himself falling/ tumbling. He mistook the 15-foot mark for the middle mark of the rope. Luckily he was at New Frontier, so he only fell approximately 30 feet. Had it been elsewhere, the fall would have been much, much worse. He suffered only a broken ankle and wrist.

A few tips to rappel safely: Know your rope’s midpoint, tie bulky knots in both ends of the rope to jam in your rappel device; use a backup such as a autoblock, prusik, or kleimheist knot on the rope; clip to your harness with a locking carabiner, have your partner double-check all systems, and finally, visually check that the rope ends reach the next station or the ground before you rappel (Source: Edited from a report on rockclimbing.com posted on 2/18/09) climbers never ","Serious, Descent, Roped, Ice Climbing, No Backup or End Knot, Rappel Error",,

On March 10, I (36) had successfully climbed the route Hot Stuff (5.10c). My two partners and I were climbing on a 70m rope, a standard length for this route. I was being lowered when the rope went through the belayer’s device resulting in my dropping about 20 feet to the belay ledge. I then bounced off the ledge, fell an additional 20 feet, and tumbled farther down the scree. Injuries included a lacerated ear, abrasions, and a concussion.
(Editor’s Note: A cellphone was used to report the incident to rescue personnel.)
Analysis
The simple solution for preventing this accident would have been to tie a knot in the end of the rope on the belayer’s end. This is normally a common practice with our group if we have any concern that the route may exceed the length of our rope or if it there is any concern of shortage.

On Sunday, March 15, an experienced South Korean mountain climber Jun Ho Wang (38) was on his way down for more supplies to support his team’s winter attempt on Half Dome when he was swept more than 100 meters down a rocky approach to the granite face by an avalanche. Two friends who were nearby tended to him and cut Wang a flat ledge the size of a twin bed out of the ice topping the rock where he could rest wrapped in three sleeping bags. He endured about 16 hours in an icy, low-lying gully before he was plucked from the monolith by a helicopter crew Tuesday morning and flown to safety.

About 4:00 p.m. on March 15, Curtis “Woody” Stark (67) and Alfred Kuok (44) were climbing in an area near the Hidden Valley nature trail. The trail is a popular destination for both day hikers and rock climbers. Stark was the lead climber on the Great Burrito formation and was being followed by Kuok. Stark experienced some difficulty with his climb and began to descend. During the descent, he lost his grip and fell. As he fell, Stark struck Kuok, causing him to fall as well. Kuok’s protection held, arresting his fall, but Stark continued to fall, suffering fatal head injuries when he struck the ground. It’s estimated that he fell about 100 feet.
Two other rock climbers immediately responded and rendered assistance to Kuok, helping lower him from the cliff face.

On May 23, one of two clients sustained an ankle injury when the guide (29) lost his footing on the descent of Mount Shuksan. He slid down a snow slope, and pulled the clients from their stance. Because of snow conditions and gradient, the guide was unable to stop himself before passing the climbers and before the slack in the rope was spent. The total fall was about 400 feet. Analysis
The guide hadn’t set any protection for himself (nor had the other climbers done so as they descended with his belay) because he was on, what was for him, moderate terrain where he felt no danger of losing his footing. It was a very unusual slip—a freak accident—for a skilled guide.
Throughout his career he has guided his clients without error, and he felt terrible about this accident.
The guide commented, “Among many other responsibilities, a guide’s job is never to fall. We put in protection on challenging terrain so that if the unexpected happens, ill consequences do not occu","Experienced, Serious, Descent, Roped, Alpine/Mountaineering",30.0,

On May 26, a climber (33) was descending un-roped with his team members along the ridge below Washburn’s Thumb at approximately 16,500 feet. At this location the terrain forces the route off the ridge onto the North side of the buttress.
The climber encountered an ascending guided expedition on this steeper, off fall-line, traversing slope. Though the guided group was placing snow pickets as fall protection on this terrain feature, he decided not to wait until the trail was clear but rather to descend the traverse above the guided group. While descending the traverse, he lost his footing, fell, and became entangled in the guided group’s rope. He suffered a dislocated shoulder.
NPS Rangers lowered him from the base of the fixed-lines to the 14,200- foot camp and attempted, but could not reduce, his shoulder dislocation.
After a span of seven days of non-flyable weather, he was evacuated on the eighth day by NPS helicopter without incident.

On June 11, two climbers (38 and 40) attempting the Cassin Ridge requested a rescue when they ran out of food and water and had no working stoves. They called on FRS and reported that they had “no energy and we cannot go up.” At this time they asked, “We wonder if possible a rescue.”
A helicopter launched around 1830 from Talkeetna. The climbers were located on a steep slope, and so the drop target was a lower-angled garden of rocks about 100 feet above them. The first drop hit the target perfectly, but it proved to be too steep and the supplies slid down the entirety of Denali’s Southwest Face. The second drop, positioned just above the first, did exactly the same. Papa Hotel (name of the helicopter) descended to base camp to re-supply and reassess its target.

On June 11, two climbers (36 and 39, US) died of injuries sustained during a fall while ascending the West Rib route. Though the origin of the fall was not witnessed, it is believed to have begun at approximately 19,200 feet. The two climbers, who were roped together, were witnessed falling at approximately the 16,000-foot level to the end of their fall around the 14,500-foot level. Subsequent to the report of the fall, a National Park Service hasty team and a group of private climbers immediately responded to the accident site and found that they had died due to injuries sustained during the fall.

As the team was climbing on the ridge between the fixed lines at 16,200-feet and the 17,200-foot camp, they became concerned with weather conditions up higher on the mountain. They arrived at 17,200-foot camp in high winds. They talked about the conditions and decided not ski “Thunderbird” but to ski down from 17,200-foot camp via the Rescue Gulley instead. The team worked their way down through the steep entrance of the Rescue Gulley and regrouped at the mouth of it to dig a snow pit and evaluate both snow conditions and the terrain below.

I was on pitch 4 of Rewritten (5.7) on August 1 when the party above me yelled down that the block was loose. I’ve climbed Rewritten before and I knew about the infamous refrigerator block balanced on the ledge above me. I didn’t think too much about the warning and kept climbing. When I got to the block, I carefully traversed around it, but when I came to the right side of the block, I stepped on a rock and my foot sank, nudging the block just enough causing it to move. I thought it might miss me, but then it hit my rope and forced me off the ledge headfirst. I ended up falling the entire pitch and was about even with my belayer when the rope finally stopped me! I yelled, “Rock!” as loud as I could, but “rock” was an understatement! I knew others were directly below me and was VERY relieved to find that they were ok. The route was completely covered in dust, pebbles, and some good-sized pieces of rock.

When I awoke in my bed on Friday morning (August 28), I was hoping it was a nightmare, but when I looked down at my left foot wrapped in a bandage and covered with an ice pack and felt the discomfort coursing up my leg, I was painfully aware it wasn’t just a nightmare and I had definitely f****d up. It could have been worse though…when a climber rappels off the end of his rope it’s generally a lot worse than a severely sprained ankle (with torn ligaments), a bruised left ass cheek and a scraped left arm.

On the afternoon of July 9th, rangers received a report that a climber had fallen approximately 400 to 500 feet while descending the Eichorn Pinnacle on Cathedral Peak. Rangers responded by helicopter and quickly located the climber, identified as Christina Chan (31). Her body was removed from the scene via short-haul by a park contract helicopter.
Analysis
Chan was a very experienced climber, with roped-solo ascents of difficult Grade VI routes on El Capitan. According to those who interacted with her on Cathedral Peak that day, she was in good spirits and climbing with skill and confidence. Eric Cohen caught a glimpse of about 20 feet of Chan’s fall, but no one knows what caused it. Free-soloing is here to stay, but even the lowest grade levels can be fatal when the rope is left in the car.

Twist and Crawl is about a 35-39-meter route. The leader (53) of the route, clipped draws to the anchor chains and was to be lowered off. The belayer’s (mid-50s) end of the rope wasn’t tied to her and she let the 60-meter rope end slide through the device, resulting in the leader falling to the ground. He sustained lacerations, abrasions, a fracture, and a concussion.

In early September, an experienced climber (age unknown) on Tape Worm (5.12d) took a lead fall from a point between the first and second bolt. His rope ran from his belay, through a quickdraw hanging from the first bolt, to his harness. On this particular route, the first bolt is located high enough that he would not have decked under normal circumstances. Unfortunately, when he fell, his rope was completely severed by the lower carabiner on the quickdraw attached to the first bolt, and he did deck. He sustained head injuries and is on his way to a fall recovery.
Analysis
The quickdraw in question is comprised of two Trango carabiners marked: “Trango Italy.” The CE 0638 rating on each 'biner is 24 kilo-Newtons in line with the spine and four kilo-Newtons perpendicular to the spine.

On Sept. 18, Toni Alegre (42) and Jorge Lantero (43) started climbing the Nose of El Capitan (31 pitches, Grade VI). They led on double ropes (one red and one green) and moved quickly, practicing for a later attempt to climb the route in a day. From the anchor at the top of pitch 6, Lantero pendulumed into the left-facing corner about 30 feet to the right and began climbing the corner. As he placed protection, he clipped only his red rope through the pieces, but after several placements he began clipping both ropes. Using this method he protected all of pitch 7 for himself while also leaving a high pivot point for the green rope, so that when Alegre followed him on green, he would swing slowly across without risk of injury.
When Lantero reached the pitch 7 anchor and looked down, however, he realized that he might have clipped the green rope too low on the pitch. He warned Alegre that he might swing too fast into the corner because of the large p","Experienced, Serious, Roped, Trad Climbing, Pendulum",,

A good practice to follow before going on belay is to do a pull test on all autoblock devices when they are in autoblock mode, even if you’re sure the device is threaded the right way. (Source: www.mountainproject.com)","Serious, Descent, Roped, Ice Climbing, Lowering Error",,

On February 22 at 1120, Wray Landon (31) was caught in an avalanche and carried to his death while skiing near the summit of the South Teton. Landon was skiing with partners Nathan Brown (32) and Brady Johnston (27). Both searched the slide path for Landon immediately after the avalanche occurred. They descended the path to the edge of a steep cliff where they could see something in the debris field over 1000 feet below, though they could not tell if it was Landon. At that point, Brown called 911 and was connected to Park Dispatch.

On February 27, my two partners and I were getting ready to climb Mercury’s Lead off the tree ledge. Two young women (I’ll call them Jane and Joan) came walking down from the far end of the tree ledge and said they planned to lead the Great Arch (5.5). We chatted for a little bit and while Joan was racking up for her lead, our leader started off on Mercury’s with me belaying. He got to the first bolt and was scoping out the rock above. Since he was in a secure spot, I felt comfortable glancing over to see how things were going on the Arch.
Joan had placed a piece of pro (a medium cam) about ten feet up and was climbing above it into the section where the crack widens before turning the first corner, approximately 20 feet up on the route. She was making a series of layback moves and when she got up to the corner, her hands came off.

The body of Ralph Fickle (59), an experienced climber and guide, was found on March 4 about 200 feet below the Blue Ridge Parkway, a half- mile south of the Bluffs Restaurant at Doughton Park. Apparently, Ralph was free-soloing Farmer’s Daughter. It seems that about 90 feet up and 10 feet from where the climb backs off and the lower angle ice tops out, the free hanging curtain of ice he was on completely fractured. Ralph had rigged a top anchored bail out line in case he felt the need to retreat. His ATC was clipped to the belay loop of his harness. Due to the large section of ice that broke, he did not have time to retrieve the line.
Ralph fell to the base of the climb and slid down slope. He suffered head trauma and did not pass instantly, but soon after coming to a stop, as evidenced by the fact that he had time to remove gloves and touch the wound, but not much after that.

Saturday was also warm and sunny, so there was a significant amount of water running over the snow and ice in the gully. One party of two had climbed the first pitch and was preparing to rappel off due to the excessive water. Another party, including a local guide (KM) and his two clients had also climbed the first pitch, but rather than contend with the water, the guide climbed out of the gully on the rock to the right.

Two experienced 26-year-old climbers (Mr. Thomas and Mr. Tom Bennett) were spending the weekend on the north side of Mount Shasta (very rarely used at this time of the year due to snow covered road access). They climbed the Bolam Glacier on March 26th and then the Whitney on March 27. They summited late and experienced extremely high winds in the summit plateau area. While they had experienced wind while climbing, they were somewhat sheltered by the terrain above the glacier. High winds and a lenticular cloud had formed in front of an approaching storm. The storm was not forecast to have much precipitation (compared to the norm on Mt. Shasta), but strong winds are common in front of a storm and behind it. The winds made it nearly impossible to stand, so they decided to dig a snow cave and descend at first light. They had good clothing, equipment and training to bivy overnight.

Before Drew started the second pitch, I decided to make the anchor redundant by slinging a smaller boulder located under the larger primary boulder. Drew started the pitch and climbed about 30 feet, placed a cam (unknown #), climbed an additional ten feet, then fell.
I was yanked directly to the left, which loaded the smaller boulder, dislodging it. It would have fallen, but I had it slung tight enough that it stayed attached, hanging below me! It was heavy enough (maybe a couple of hundred pounds) that it prevented me from moving.

Generally speaking, it’s not considered all that difficult a climb, he said, but “it’s quite spectacular.” He also stated, ""... but ice conditions can change so quickly that it’s hard to say what the difficulty is from day to day.”

On May 29, Bill Trull (age unknown) was climbing in a recently developed climbing area across from the Bihedral Rock. The climb was located on the south side of Boulder Creek. Trull did not fall but became injured during the climb due to a previous, unrelated injury. He was climbing on a top rope and was lowered to the base of the climb.
When the Boulder Fire ladder truck arrived it was determined the ladder would reach across the river at a narrow point. The ladder was extended across the river and Trull was loaded into the ladder bucket and brought back across the river.

During the morning of July 26, a group of seven climbers were traversing the ridge between Mount Wilson (14,246 feet) and El Diente (14,159 feet) peaks, one of Colorado’s four classic 14’er traverses.
According to reports, a group of four climbers Peter Topp (59), Charlie Zimmerman (60), Kathy (36), and Shawn Sullivan were on their way from Mount Wilson to meet with three unidentified climbers who had reached the summit of El Diente. The three were heading toward the others when they heard the sound of falling rocks and cries for help.
During the ensuing rockslide, Topp was rendered unconscious and later died from blunt force trauma to his head and body. Zimmerman sustained a head injury and internal injuries and with support was able to descend from 14,000 feet to a landing zone some 700 feet below. Kathy Donnelly had to be transported to the landing zone in a litter after dislocating and fracturing her hip in the accident.

Duane (57) and Linda Buhrmester (56), both experienced climbers, walked in from the trailhead to Upper Colony Lake on July 26 in the mid afternoon. They camped there for the night with the intent on climbing the Ellingwood Arête (5.7+) on Crestone Needle (14,197 feet).
Investigators suggested that a severe storm washed the couple off the mountain, causing them to fall about 500 feet into a mudslide area. Rescuers found the couple buried in rocks and mud. We believe this is what happened because they weren’t roped together when found (Linda had a mountaineer’s coil over her shoulder and had both ends of the rope, suggesting they had used the rope earlier and had it at the ready should they need it again). If they were in that chute with that much scree, they knew that it would have been safest for them to not be tied together because of the potential for the rope to get caught on loose rock and cause rockfall.

On July 27, a climbing party of four, including a father, his two teen-aged sons, and Lee Adams (52), was descending the Emmons glacier when one of the climbers tripped and fell. This caused the other climbers to be swept off their feet and, despite attempts to self-arrest, they slid approximately 100 feet on a steep slope and plummeted into a 35-foot-deep crevasse at about the 13,000-foot level. Two sustained minor injuries and one briefly lost consciousness and injured his right knee. Adams, the last man on the rope, died from traumatic injuries. The three surviving climbers were able to climb out of the crevasse and make their way back to Camp Schurman, the high camp at 9,450 feet, arriving at 1500.

Once off the glacier, we began to climb the north face route. It was a bit wet in areas so we had to bypass on the right of the actual route.

On Saturday, September 25 Maria Petzolt (26) dislocated her shoulder unexpectedly while pulling on a hold on the fourth pitch of Ruper (5.8), a 6-pitch route on the Redgarden Wall. Maria had dislocated the same shoulder five weeks earlier on another outing. Her male climbing partner lowered her to a secure position a few feet lower and called 911 on his cell phone. When rescuers arrived, they administered medication and reduced the shoulder after a few attempts. Ms. Petzolt was tandem-lowered to the base of the wall. She refused an ambulance and was transported to a hospital in a private vehicle. (Source: Steve Muehlhauser, Park Ranger, Eldorado Canyon State Park)

On September 25, Bennet Harris (30) and Tom Drewes (34) were climbing Arms Control (5.11c). Tom was about to pull the final roof. I was watching him climb extremely closely as I intended to climb the route and wanted to see what he did.
He placed a 48-inch sling on the last bolt he clipped at the roof and a 24-inch sling combined with a quick draw to extend it on his second-to-last bolt. Because he had climbed past a smaller roof, a lead fall should have put him in the air. I watched him lean out to grab the jug beyond the big roof. His hand looked a little shaky as he reached for the hold, leaning far back from his stance under the roof. I remember thinking, “If he’s having trouble reaching for that, I’m really going to be in trouble.”
At this point he fell, and stopped about eight to ten feet below where he started, in mid-air. (Four feet of this was due to the sling). It did not look like a bad fall; it looked safe and his belayer caught the","Serious, Roped, Sport, grade:5.11c",20.0,

The slab ran approximately 400 vertical feet over a small cliff band, and avalanche debris washed down two gullies on either side of the rocky cliff feature to the west edge of St. Mary's Lake. It is not known for certain at this point how far the victim was carried in the debris, nor whether or not he was washed over the cliff and/or down one of the gullies.  Tracks coming down the bed surface from the crown of the avalanche and through the debris indicate the victim was likely carried over the cliff band. There are two sets of tracks exiitng the debris near the lake.
The victim sustained minor injuries to his ankle, and banged up his head during the slide. Fortunately, he was wearing a helmet.","buried:0, killed:0",,

The gully is a popular alternative to the steeper, more involved approach that can be made downstream of the routes.
Ten years ago we made the steeper descent to the creek but walked out via the gully.

On Saturday, January 29, Eric, Ward, Ned, Arnold and I were planning on attempting Mount Meeker (13,911 feet) via the Iron Gates route that eventually diverges from the Chasm Lake trail and follows a generally Class-2 ridge to one of the summits. The weather was gorgeous—warmer and sunnier than we possibly could have hoped—and the high winds in the area had scoured most of the alpine area around Meeker and Longs Peak clean. The snowpack was hard and stable, so for the most part, we could not punch through and we did not have to posthole through the patches of snow that we did encounter.
We continued along the Chasm Lake trail as it winds around Mount Lady Washington and follows a path cut into a steep slope. The area is cliffed-out in sections directly off the path. These portions of the trail were covered in snowdrifts, making them trickier than in the summer by far. We took out our ice axes and some of us donned crampons.

On February 4, a male climber had been rope soloing the 5.9 bolted first pitch variation to Tunnel Vision when he decided to retreat at the fourth bolt due to the pitch being harder then anticipated. When rappelling, he experienced difficulty with the device repeatedly “locking” and was trying to find a position on the lowering handle that would cause the rope to lower with less drag. (He was using a fairly new 60mxl0.2 rope.)
He had placed the handle in the fall open locked position and was trying to find a position in the handle range that he had used before to get a smooth descent. At some point, he took his hand off the brake side of the rope and began to use both hands to try and adjust the handle. There was no backup in place.
The device unlocked abruptly in mid range (between the locked open and closed handle positions) and the climber went into free fall of about 25 feet.

I was climbing Foreign Trade Zone while a party of two was top-roping some variation of Bat Out of Hell (5.11). The climber reached the top of the route while I was about halfway up Foreign Trade Zone. I heard a “whoosh” and a loud thump and looked down to see the climber yell and bounce off the ground.
My belayer lowered me and we sent a couple people up the trail to call 911 and notify Park personnel. Meanwhile, the climber’s partner, a couple others, and I tried to keep him still and attend to a small cut on the back of his head. He was alert, not injured, and otherwise seemed okay.

On Friday, March 4, I (name and age not on post) was climbing at The Motherlode on a route called Kick Me in the Jimmie (5.12) when I fell late in the day. The last fall of the last climb of the day should have been a routine, clean ~ 12-foot leader fall onto the fifth bolt. After the expected catch passed, it became clear that my belayer didn’t have control of the rope. I fell about 35 feet to the ground.
I remember bracing myself for impact, hitting the ground, and letting everyone know that I was okay about one second after I hit. I injured my ankle and my butt hurt. I was able to walk out just fine. The belayer had rope burns on the wrist of his non-brake hand.

My belayer had been climbing for ten years and I’d been climbing with him for just over a year. He was belaying with a tube-style device similar to a Wild Country VC Pro.

On March 12, around 1:00 p.m., there was a serious leader fall on the lower section of the third pitch (the long 5.8 corner) of the route Dark Shadows on the Mescalito Formation in the Pine Creek Canyon area. It seems that the leader was about 30 feet above the belay ledge with insufficient protection and slipped while trying to place gear. He dropped the gear and landed on the small ledge just above the belay right-side down. It does not appear that any gear failed.

There was one party above and one party below on the route. I was anchored just right of the Dark Shadows belay ledge at the anchor of Slot Machine (instead of rappelling to the Dark Shadows anchors). I saw about the last five feet of the fall. It was extremely disturbing.

Fortunately the rope got tight at the very last second, so I didn’t fully impact the ground. But still, I broke my pelvis and two vertebrae.

Here is why I think this happened. First of all, my belayer got distracted as soon as I decided to rest for a few seconds. I saw him talking with people while I started falling.

Local caretakers from the AMC also heard their voices while skiing and went over to assist.
Due to the unfortunate location where he came to rest, stabilization and extrication was difficult and took longer than usual for accidents in this area.

Dave was found at the bottom with the rope attached to his harness with a figure-eight on a bight tied at the mid-point of the rope.
Analysis
Dave Pinegar was an experienced climber from Germany. There are a couple of points here that should be clear. First, he obviously wasn’t clipped into the anchor, and second, Walk On The Wild Side is usually a double-rope rappel with either 50 or 60-meter ropes.
A single 70-meter is pretty short for this task. Locals seem to concur that the 70-meter, single-rope rap is pushing it.

On May 28, Colin Gregg (34) was top-roping the first pitch of C’est La Vie (5.9) on Redgarden Wall. He had difficulty at a crux about 30 feet off the starting belay ledge (which is about 25 feet above ground level) and partially hung on the rope. The belayer reported that a lot of slack suddenly came into the system. When he tried to take in the slack, he noticed that the rope had come untied from the climber’s harness. Gregg could not clip into fixed gear in his vicinity and though he fought to stay on the rock, he fell. Somehow his fall stopped roughly at the level of the starting belay ledge, saving him from an additional 25-foot fall to ground level.
Greg was alert and oriented after the fall, but complained of lumbar back pain. He was evacuated and transported to a hospital by ambulance. It is unknown whether the victim’s tie-in knot was too loose, unfinished, or tied incorrectly.

Initial descriptions of events leading to the injury were that someone in Dave’s party led Dobie Gillis (5.8) a climb about halfway up the wall and set anchors for a top rope belay and then lowered to the ground. Based on initial reports, Dave tied into the end of the original lead rope and climbed to the mid-wall anchors. Upon reaching the anchors, Dave and his belayer somehow got their signals mixed up.

During the mid-afternoon on June 15, Jonathan Sullivan (20) fell approximately 100 feet to his death at Ravens Roost Overlook along the Blue Ridge Parkway.

Analysis
According to reports, it was Sullivan’s first day climbing outdoors. Investigators said the probable cause of the fall was the failure of a knot securing the one-inch tubular webbing anchor sling. The single sling anchor (non-redundant) extended from a large tree to the cliff edge. Evidence suggested that the person constructing the top rope anchor placed a “temporary” knot or hitch in the webbing to hold it in place but became distracted and never finished tying the knot to complete the anchor.

He most likely took a pendulum fall to the right, hitting his left ankle on a ledge below the final headwall. The left ankle was broken laterally towards the outside, suggesting that Andy was moving to the right when he hit the ledge. The ledge slopes upwards towards climber’s left so it might have been closer to him than if he was more in line with the bolts.

We had spent a long and very hot day in the sun with two liters of water each (plus keeping a third liter each in reserve for the descent), and we were climbing on three hours of sleep for each of the last three days, due mostly to travel from the East Coast.
We had no problems until we got to our seventh rappel, where there is only a tree with a bunch of slings and rap rings.

On July 9, Darrell Kangiser (25) lead the first pitch of The Bastille Crack (5.8). When he arrived at the anchor (~35 feet above the ground), his belayer (23) thought he saw the leader signal that he was off belay, so the belayer let go. The leader leaned back to be lowered and fell to the ground. Fortunately the rope was still running through the belayer’s belay device and this provided some friction to slightly slow the leader’s fall to the ground. The leader landed on his feet and reported low back pain. He was transported by ambulance to a hospital.

On July 24, Nathan Turner (30) and his partner were in the second rappel of “Jill’s Thrill,” a common descent route for the area. The first rappel placed the two climbers onto a small ledge without incident. They lowered safely onto the ledge and setup their second rappel by threading the rope through the second set of chain anchors. Setup took longer than expected. Turner mentioned to his partner that it felt like he’d been “pulling rope a long time.” After this was said, they saw black markings on the rope signaling what they believed was the middle of their rope. Turner threw the side of the rope he’d been pulling up over the ledge and then setup his ATC to rappel. Last checks were made and he began his descent.
It started well enough. No failure occurred when the climber first took himself off his personal anchor. The failure occurred after a few seconds of lowering.

On July 24, Nathan Turner (30) was on the second rappel of Jill’s Thrill at Beacon Rock. But he had threaded the single rope through a fixed anchor with both ends of the rope over the ledge. This left the rope ends not visible. He then mistakenly centered the rope on the manufacturer’s warning marking – six meters from the end. The uneven rope went un-noticed, as part of it was hung up out of view on a lower ledge. Without stopper knots and no belay backup device, Turner rappelled about 15 feet before his belay device passed the short end of the rope resulting in a 100-foot fatal free fall.

On September 24, Brian C. Jones (37) slipped on the 35-degree friable volcanic rock slope below the summit of North Sister and tumbled down about 1,000 vertical feet to his death.
Jones “…was scrambling on some of the terrain near his climbing partner and he slipped, started sliding, and then cart wheeled down the mountain,” according to the report from Lane County Sheriff’s volunteer SAR unit.
Analysis
North Sister is a fourth-class route under normal conditions, approached along the top of the south ridge by a faint “climber’s way” high up along the west side of a gendarme called The Camel’s Hump. The route then winds to the east side of a second gendarme, then traverses across an exposed, friable 3 5 degree slope called the “Terrible Traverse” just under the Prouty Pinnacles to a gully called “The Bowling Alley” that leads to the summit blocks. Many groups equipped with helmets and rock climbing skills will elect to set a hand line across this traverse and then ","No/Little, Deadly, Unroped , Solo, Non-climbing, Alpine/Mountaineering",,

I had relatively good gear with my last piece being maybe seven feet below me, when my right foot blew. I immediately lost it and came off. As I fell I saw the rope coiling through the gear, hoping it would hold, as the last piece was a small Mastercam. It held, but only really caught me about a foot above the ledge/slab that the dihedral started out of. I crashed my entire weight onto my right foot, and in an effort to crumple as much as possible, I slid backwards a ways down the slab. I immediately heard/felt the explosion in my ankle and began yelling down to my belayer to prepare to lower me.

I had fixed four pitches by myself two days earlier, and we hoped to finish it off in a day. Working in the Valley had allowed me to crank out 11 big walls in the previous six months, but this would be the last for a while— the start of a relaxing sabbatical.
We jugged the fixed lines, and after I led pitches five through eight as a block, Taylor took the rest. We were using a 60-m lead line and a 60-m x 10-mm static tag line, the latter for lower-outs, shuttling gear, and retreat if necessary.

Unconscious but still breathing, she suffered a fractured forearm and possible spinal cord injury since she could not move her feet on command. She was carried on a backboard to a waiting helicopter and flown to the nearest trauma hospital.
According to witnesses, the cause of the accident was an unfinished tie-in knot. The climber tied her own knot, but unfortunately did not finish it. When she reached the anchors and sat in her harness, the knot came untied and she fell.

Climbers in the area noted that the rope was detached from her harness, which was described as “new and intact”. The rope end was found at the anchors with a figure-of-eight knot and working end of the rope trailing from the knot. Her partner did not check her knot.

On October 24, Gary Hansen (54) and his daughter Kate (17) became stranded on Castle Rock on a ledge 200 feet up the East Face after dark as they attempted to rappel. A rescue climber from the Rocky Mountain Rescue Group climbed over Castle Rock and descended to the stranded climbers. Each of them was then lowered to the ground, and they were both safely on the ground at 10:30 p.m.
Analysis
While these were experienced climbers, the situation they found themselves in was largely attributable to a lack of familiarity with the area, and not allowing enough time for their climb to the summit. Once on the summit after dark, they chose a descent route for which they were not properly equipped. However, they then made the right decision to call for help rather than attempt to climb further in the dark in an unfamiliar area.

Then he down-climbed back to a stance to take off his gloves that he had been climbing with because it was cold. As he climbed back up, he cleaned the cam. When he climbed past the Black Diamond stopper, it fell out when the direction of pull from the rope changed. He slipped and without an upper anchor, the belay was not functioning, so he fell 2 5 feet.
Not realizing how seriously he was injured, he painfully rappelled 20 feet to the larger ledge below. At this point, it was clear to them that they could not self-rescue. The climbers had left their cell phones and day packs with their rope bags at the foot of the climb, 200 feet below.

The leader climbed a full rope length and could not find an adequate anchor. He untied from the rope to try to climb further to find viable anchors. The second started climbing, assuming he was on belay, and then slipped, fell, and tumbled 40 feet, getting airborne in the process. Rescue involved 800 feet of high-angle evacuation to a ground team, followed by a mile of lower-angle evacuation to an ambulance.
Analysis
It seems as though a lack of experience and available protection led the lead climber to believe the best option for the completion of their climb was to untie and begin a free solo to find suitable anchors. It seems there was a lack of communication between the leader and second, both for the action of untying from the rope, and for the second starting to climb.

<p>According to preliminary information, a group of six snowshoers were traveling in a narrow gully just north of Tibble Fork Reservoir in American Fork Canyon when they triggered a small avalanche. It swept one 21-year-old women into the water of the creek at the bottom and buried her face down for about 40 minutes in the water.</p>
<p>She had no pulse when she was recovered but it was reported they may have recovered a pulse either in transport or at the hospital. Media report that she passed away today, February 9th.  Our hearts go out to the family and friends with this especially tragic accident.</p>
<p>American Fork Canyon has remained closed due to extreme avalanche danger and if it opens on Monday, we will have one of our forecasters visit the site and work up a more complete accident investigation.</p>

Thompson and Scherer separated near Hidden Valley around 5:30 p.m. Scherer headed toward the vehicle, and Thompson went to pack up their camp from the night before and then head to Bunny Flat. Scherer was not at their car when he arrived. Thompson waited and then called a cab and went to the Alpine Motel for the night. He knew Scherer had enough supplies for the night. When he had not heard from Scherer the next morning, Thompson called 911.

I built a redundant anchor out of two cams and belayed my daughter while she came up, then belayed her while she downclimbed.
Not wanting to leave my gear, I removed the cams and built a rappel anchor by inserting a rap ring into a piece of webbing tied around a peanut-shaped boulder about three feet long, sitting on a horizontal ledge with other rocks wedged in above it. The peanut seemed solid and resisted any attempts to budge it. Halfway down my 10-foot rap, as the angle of the slab got steeper, I heard the peanut start to move above me.

Best guess is that the climber either kicked or snagged the draw while making the next long move, causing the carabiner to shift on the bolt hanger. During the fall, the carabiner broke because it was not meant to be loaded on other than its main axis. Carabiners have been known to break in such fashion due to the carabiner being snagged, rotated, or cross-loaded on the bolt hanger.

Upon arrival, Davis noted that Dunn was still alive but unconscious. Despite being administered CPR, Dunn never regained consciousness. He was airlifted from Tahquitz in a helicopter.

They descended on their own power to the 17,200- foot camp on the West Buttress route and contacted an NPS ranger patrol there. One climber (39) reported a lower-leg injury and that she had trouble walking. Another (37) reported an arm injury and said the team was worried about continuing to descend unassisted.
One NPS team assisted the injured climbers down the ridge to the top of the fixed lines and then passed them off to another NPS team, who lowered them down the lines and helped them back to the 14,200-foot camp. The climbers waited for the rest of their team to descend from high camp, and then they all continued their descent unassisted.

A pre-rappel check should always include you and your partner(s) double-checking the anchor and visually inspecting the ropes to be sure they reach their intended destination, and that the rope ends are even and each have stopper knots.

I assumed we would be climbing Exum Ridge and I would be in the lead, with no one else in front. However, the weather changed our plans and we ended up doing the Owen-Spalding. A client in a guided party out in front of us kicked off a potato-size rock and didn't shout, ""Rock!"" The rock bounced down and hit me on top of the head.

I was bleeding but never lost consciousness. After doing a self-assessment of my condition, I stuck a handkerchief on the injured area, pulled on my wool hat, and brought my clients up.

I did not expect us to be on the Owen-Spalding, where there are more climbers, especially inexperienced ones. I might have made a different decision if I’d anticipated this. If the client above us had yelled “Rock!” I probably would have been able to dodge the bullet.

Paul lagged behind during the approach march, and the two experienced heavy rockfall while crossing two snowfields. They arrived at the base of the route at 8:30 a.m.
They moved slowly through the lower pitches, encountering loose rock throughout. On pitch seven, Tony pulled off a large flake, which hit belayer on the back after falling 15 feet. Fortunately, Paul was uninjured, largely due to the larger flake breaking into two pieces prior to striking him and then impacting his full CamelBak hydration system, absorbing some of the blow.

Unfortunately, Person 1 connected his rope to a previously established anchor that was designed for highlining (high-level slacklining) rather than climbing. Person 2 had previously warned Person 1 about using these anchors, because they were not designed for a rappel or in a good position to inspect the climb. Person 2 suggested Person 1 place new anchor bolts atop the cliff for better access to the new route; however, Person 1 did not heed this warning.

After threading his ropes through the two-bolt anchor at the top of the cliff he began to rappel. Seconds later, his friends stated, the rappeller was out of sight and the rope pulled all the way through the anchor.

Rescuers carried the victim half a mile through the woods before reaching an ATV to take him another mile down a narrow trail to a hastily constructed helicopter landing zone. He was flown to Johnson City Medical Center in east Tennessee.

Rescuers stated that upon arrival at the scene they found the rope with a friction hitch (type unknown) wrapped around one strand of rope. They also noted that there were no blocking knots tied on the rope ends. It appears the climber failed to equalize the rope ends and misjudged the height of the cliff.

One of the climbers rappelled off the ends of the rope. He fell about five meters and landed on his back, sustaining a lower back injury described as a fracture, and had to be evacuated.
ANALYSIS
This accident was attributed to inadequate communication and a failure to double check the length of the route relative to the length of the rope. The guidebook notes the climb is 31 meters high, making it very difficult to rappel safely with a single 60-meter rope. Tying stopper knots in the ends of the rope before rappelling could have prevented the climber from hitting the ground.","Serious, Descent, Roped, Sport, No Backup or End Knot, Rappel Error, Miscommunication",146.0,62.0

In this incident knots on both ends of the rope would have resulted in a different outcome. Before descending, always do a pre-rappel check: You and your partner(s) should check the anchor, check the ropes to be sure they reach their intended destination and are even, and be sure they have blocking knots on both ends.

RMI guides helped to extract the suspended climber by reaching into the crevasse and lifting him up and out. Once the climber was on the surface, the guides assessed the patient and noticed a possible shoulder dislocation. With the help of the climber’s partner, the guides reduced the possible shoulder dislocation. Rangers then assisted the climber in descending to Paradise, where he was advised to seek medical care.

ANALYSIS
Based on eyewitness accounts, it is believed the accident was the result of a failed “biner block” rappel setup. The biner block is commonly used by canyoneers mak- ing long rappels, so they can use a single full-strength rope and then retrieve the rope by pulling on a much lighter cord. At the anchor, the rappel rope is tied to a carabiner that blocks the smaller rope from pulling through","Moderate, Deadly, Descent, Roped, Knot & Tie-in Error, Anchor Failure / Error, Rappel Error",,

Editor’s note: Another Red Rock rappelling fatality occurred in March, when Todd Jenkins, 41, fell to the ground in Black Velvet Canyon. The experienced climber had completed a sport route that was too long for lowering. He went off-belay and threaded the rope at the anchor, intending to rappel once to a midway anchor and then make a second rappel to the ground. However, the rope strands for his first rappel apparently were uneven in length.
As he was cleaning quickdraws en route to the midway anchor, he did not notice the shorter rope end pass through his rappel device, causing him to fall to the ground. Greater care with ensuring the rope lengths were even or tying stopper knots in the ends likely could have prevented this tragic accident.","Experienced, Deadly, Descent, Roped, Sport, No Backup or End Knot, Anchor Failure / Error, Rappel Error",,

Sarah Hart, 35, and I, 32, intended to climb the east ridge of 13,832-foot Mt. Hayes, the tallest peak in the eastern Alaska Range, from the Trident Glacier. The Trident was flat and windswept, and the snow surface was so hard that we didn’t even leave footprints in the crust. We decided it would be fine to cross the glacier to the base of the ridge unroped.
I walked in front, wearing a harness, while Sarah walked behind me with the rope. It was Sarah's idea that whoever carried the rope should go second, in the unlikely event of a crevasse fall. I only made it a few hundred meters across the flat glacier from the tent before breaking through a hidden snow bridge and falling into a crevasse. The distance that I fell was never measured, but I think it was as much as 60 feet.

ANALYSIS
For crampons to be safe and effective, they must be properly sized and firmly fastened to the climbing boot, and straps and clothing must be tightened or secured so they can’t cause the climber to trip and fall. After crampons are donned, kicking them against hard snow and rapping the sides with an ice axe can help determine if they are securely attached.

ANALYSIS
The climbers (ranging in age from late 20s to 30s) were experienced and well equipped. It is not possible to say exactly what caused them to fall, but investigators reported there was no avalanche debris at the base of the route. It appears most likely that one climber fell with either inadequate protection or anchor (or both) and pulled the others off.

At this point, the climber and belayer began discussing a descent/lowering plan for the first time.

In good weather, the group climbed several short rock walls, the last of which was 45 feet tall. Feeling confident, the climbers ascended this final wall without roping up or placing protection, with Weddell in the lead. According to Weddell, “On the very last move, what I thought was a solid right hand broke off.” (Weddell reports testing the hold prior to committing to the move.) He fell 20 feet, striking a ledge where Kealty stood, and then fell a further 20 feet to the base of the wall.

Two climbers headed up Voyage of the Cow Dog, a three- pitch 5.9. One of them (age 20) was following the third pitch when he dislodged a microwave-size block above shoulder level. The rock fell and lacerated his right lower leg to the point where a bone was visible. He was unable to rappel without assistance, so the climbers called 911 for help. Rescue teams responded and assisted with the rappel.

Voyage of the Cow Dog does not see the same level of traffic as many of Smith Rock’s routes, and the Picnic Lunch Wall is known for having some poorer rock.

The climber (age approximately 18) fell much farther than I would have expected and made contact with a ledge partway up the route. She was lowered to the ground and was clearly in great pain. I went to assist and quickly determined that her ankle was either sprained or broken.

A guided Sierra Wilderness Seminars team was on the route and witnessed the fall. They quickly descended to where Murphy came to rest. Two of the clients on the trip were ER doctors from San Francisco. Impressively, they were able to perform a tracheotomy using a CamelBak hose and bladder, and though the patient was unconscious, the off-duty doctors were able to establish an airway.

A similar accident occurred on Mt. Washington in July, when a climber was hit by rockfall while rappelling the upper mountain. Both incidents suggest the importance of using a backup, such as a friction hitch, when rappelling in areas of loose rock.

Near treeline, Walker’s friends decided to turn back, and he continued to the summit solo. Late that afternoon, SAR resources were dispatched when he did not return to the parking lot. An advance team reached the summit lookout that night and reported no signs of Walker.

Raleigh reached the end of the rope without finding an anchor, so he asked his partner (40 years of experience) to take him off belay, so he could continue climbing and searching for an anchor.
Raleigh spotted a precarious stack of granite that he thought might be secure enough to sling for a rappel anchor. He tested the pile by hitting it with a tool and then pulling on it. Although apprehensive about the anchor’s stability, he had no better option, so he wrapped a 10-foot 6mm cord around the rocks and tied the ends together with a flat figure-8 knot, visually checking and tugging the knot to test it.

The class chose a snow climb on the northwest face of McCallum Peak, off the Canwell Glacier in the eastern Alaska Range.
This trip would involve a six-mile approach to a proposed campsite at around 4,500 feet on a glacier on the north aspect of McCallum Peak. From there, the climb would consist of glacier travel and climbing on moderate snow slopes, up to 50°, to the summit at 6,700 feet. The students’ plan was to leave early on Saturday to make the relatively flat approach to the campsite.

As the climb doc for the Breast Cancer Fund Climb Against the Odds, I was waiting on the summit for the last rope team of our group, led by Shasta Mountain Guides. Senior guide Rich Meyer observed an independent climber fall off the south side of the summit pinnacle. He fell approximately 25 feet vertically over rime-covered rock, then tumbled another 100 feet down firm, icy snow, coming to a rest on the summit plateau.
I descended on skis to reach the climber, who was one of several leaders of a large group of Boy Scouts that had ascended the east side of Mt. Shasta on a multi-day climb. I immediately made an assessment.

Using the equipment on his harness, he was able to transfer his weight to a friction hitch around the rope, but even though he made several attempts to ascend the ropes, he was unable to make any real progress. Chavez dialed 911 from the summit when he was unable to communicate with his partner and the rope remained under tension for too long.

It was reported that the belayer was pulled up while catching the fall and may have been slightly injured.
While climbing the second pitch of the route, the leader had reached a stance and placed a nut, but he was unhappy with the placement. While trying to remove the nut and find a better placement, he lost his balance and fell. He attempted to catch himself and dislocated his shoulder from the sudden jolt. About 10 feet below he hit a ledge, resulting in the ankle injury, then fell about 15 feet farther before his rope arrested him.
A team climbing above saw the accident, fixed their ropes, rappelled down, and assisted the leader as his partner lowered him to the first big ledge they could reach.

The leader placed a number 4 Camalot for his last piece of protection. He was five or six feet above this Camalot when he came off, falling approximately 15 feet and landing on a ledge and striking his right hip. There was 150 to 170 feet of rope in service at the time of the fall.
The climber was able to stand up and secure an anchor in order to bring up the second. However, every time he internally or externally rotated his right hip, he experienced moderate pain in the joint. Fearing that he may have had a pelvic fracture, the party initiated a rescue by calling 911.

The climber’s partner (mid-20s) planned to lead the entire route. The two had met through Mountain Project and had never climbed together before.

The female climber believes that they were off route at various stages in the climb, and around the seventh pitch, the leader definitely got off route. In this area, the standard route makes a long traverse onto the east face of Nez Perce, avoiding a steep step that is home to the Garnet Traverse Variation (III 5.8). The leader reportedly began up the Garnet Traverse face before making a traverse back toward the east face. He was unable to protect this traverse. When the second climber arrived at this traverse, she broke a handhold and took a large, swinging fall to the right, using her feet and legs to protect her body from colliding with the rock.

After successfully negotiating the climb to the final move, Grupper fell approximately 55 feet and landed feet-first in the water below.
Multiple witnesses reported that Grupper seemed to bend forward just before impact, causing his upper body and head to impact the water at a slight angle. Upon surfacing, he was picked up by an event watercraft, whose driver immediately called for the medical team to evaluate Grupper. He was transferred to the medical support boat, evaluated for injuries, and evacuated to a nearby hospital. Grupper was determined to have suffered a concussion and a broken tooth from the impact of the fall. (Sources: Seth Hawkins, MD, and Deb Simon, RN, Vertical Medicine Resources.)

These climbers were using a 40-meter rope—much too short for a climb this long. The rope had been cut to a length suitable for gym climbing but not for most outdoor use. A stopper knot in the end of the rope (or tying in the belayer) would have prevented this accident, despite the inappropriate rope. In addition, neither climber was wearing a helmet.

I screamed for help, then managed to pull myself up with the rope and unclip the nose-hooked 'biner from my ankle. My partner lowered me to the ground. Miraculously, I had no tendon damage or other serious wounds, and only needed two stitches to close the wound.

Analysis

Though my leg was not behind the rope, the position of the rope and the protection did allow my leg to slide along the rope and catch on the runner below. When my partner cleaned the route later that day, he said that where I had placed my leg felt like the natural spot. It seems like a freak accident.

While racking up, Josh noticed that no one in the group had any gear larger than a number 3 Black Diamond Camalot. Nevertheless, after a game of rock, paper, scissors to decide who would lead, Josh started up the climb, with Jordan belaying.
He placed his first piece at about seven feet. After climbing an additional 10 feet, he began to look for a second placement, but the crack was too wide for the number 3. After discussion with his partners on the ground, Josh decided to try to sling a chockstone in the crack at his waist. Drew tossed a sling up to Josh and he successfully girth-hitched the chockstone.

She planned to rappel from the anchor. She established the rappel and started down, but 25 feet above the ground she rappelled off the end of one strand of the rope. The climber fell to the ground and sustained significant fractures to both lower legs and a shoulder injury.

ANALYSIS

For unknown reasons, the rope ends were uneven when the climber set up the rappel, and neither she nor her belayer noticed the problem. Before committing to a rappel, it’s a good practice to ask people below, if possible, if both rope ends are down. No stopper knots were tied at the ends of each strand of rope. Although some climbers may feel that such knots are unnecessary for single-pitch rappels that end at the ground, in this case stopper knots likely would have prevented a serious accident.

The climber sustained life-threatening injuries, including a skull fracture and broken pelvis. His two climbing partners, one of whom was a doctor, stabilized him as best they could on a sloping ice ledge while awaiting a rescue. Kananaskis Country Public Safety technicians heli-slung the climber from the ledge and transported him to an air ambulance.

ANALYSIS

The injured climber was an experienced and skilled ice climber. This climb is notorious for being somewhat sandbagged and often has extensive wet or chandeliered ice on the second pitch. The climber had placed seven screws before his fall. Certain routes and certain conditions carry inherent risk that cannot be mitigated. As the climber acknowledged, they should not have attempted this route on that day.

Carlsberg has an “approach pitch” that starts out with a steep little pillar (WI3) and then continues for another 30 meters of low-angled ice to reach a large ledge below the main route. After climbing the steep part of the approach pitch with no protection, the leader placed an ice screw and continued up the easier terrain, placing one more screw in good ice. Somewhere near the end of the pitch, he was preparing to place another screw when he fell, sliding down the low-angled ice and then flying over the steep section before his partner caught the fall, stopping him 10 meters above the ground. The total fall distance was estimated at 25 meters.

During the long fall, the leader slammed his feet into the ice and broke both of his ankles.

He landed on his tailbone and hit his head on a rock but fortunately was not seriously hurt.

ANALYSIS

The hazards of fixed quickdraws are well-established. These quickdraws had been in place for about a year. The webbing on one of them broke at the upper carabiner (bolt end) and the other at the rope end. This climb receives little to no sun, but wind in the gorge likely caused the quickdraws to swing back and forth, abrading the webbing. Cannon said he did not see any damage to the draws, but the abrasion could have been hidden on the inside of the webbing.

ANALYSIS
Frigidator Crack is located between the main wall of Junkyard and a large detached flake that creates a narrow cave. The anchors for this route are easily accessible from the top of the cliff and are often used by climbers and guides to rappel. While the rappel is not difficult to set up, the bottom of the cave can be difficult to see clearly in low light conditions, and this likely contributed to the climber’s rope ends being uneven.

Hood while descending a south side route, resulting in a 700-foot fall. He was equipped for a snowboard descent (soft boots and self-arresting ski poles), resulting in his inability to self-arrest. The climber had an ice axe on his backpack and wore strap-on crampons on his boots in difficult surface conditions (hard snow and ice). Fellow climbers who went to Sumi’s aid were threatened by falling ice and rocks as the day warmed. A Port- land Mountain Rescue (PMR) team responded but was unable to revive the climber. 
ANALYSIS For hard snow or ice, proper footwear (rigid mountaineering boots with steel cram- pons) is needed for kicking steps and effectively using crampons. An ice axe is a better choice than self-arresting ski poles in such conditions. When self-arrest is doubtful, a rope and running protection should be used to safeguard against a fall.

Their goal was to make first ascents of peaks in this remote region by climbing rock routes in single-push style. The day of the accident, the climbers had split into two parties, opting to climb neighboring ridgelines on the same peak. With a two-day window of stable weather, they each planned to ascend approximately 1,500 feet of class 4 and 5 terrain to the summit.

It was a cold day (10° F), but there had been a recent stretch of warm weather and rain. We’d talked about canceling the trip, given the recent weather, but decided to climb anyway. 
Don led the climb and headed up a 70-foot section of 50° ice to the crux, a 15-foot vertical section. He placed several screws on the low-angle start and placed another at the base of the crux before continuing up toward what he thought was solid ice. The ice sounded hollow, so he continued to climb, looking for better ice and planning to rest in a large slot at the top of the crux section. This slot was eight to ten feet tall and had been melted by rainwater. I had noted to myself that the ice looked bad in that spot but didn’t mention it to my brother. 
My belay was in a blind spot, so I couldn’t see him climb into that area, but as he entered the V-shaped slot, he found mor","Serious, Head / Brain Injury, Roped, Ice Climbing, Poor Cond/Seasonal Risk, Run Out, Inadequate Protection / Pulled, grade:WI3",111.0,

The individual was believed to have been skiing alone in the backcountry area near Hoyt Peak, located northeast of Kamas City.
Search and Rescue (SAR) resources were immediately deployed and initiated a coordinated search. Due to hazardous and ineffective searching conditions, SAR commanders made the decision to temporarily suspend the search late on March 7, with plans to resume operations at sunrise. Search efforts resumed at first light on March 8.

During the initial search, SAR teams identified an area where an avalanche had recently occurred. It was unclear at that time whether the overdue skier had been involved in the avalanche. Due to extremely hazardous conditions, additional resources were requested to assist with avalanche mitigation, allowing searchers to operate safely and effectively.

McKinley. One climber was on skis and the other on a splitboard. They were descending together, around 20-30 feet apart, when the slab fractured above them. They were both caught and carried approximately 1,500' coming to rest near the toe of the debris. The splitboarder was partially buried up to his waist and able to self rescue. The skier was buried with one arm exposed and face several inches under the snow. Both members were wearing avalanche transceivers and carried a probe and shovel.

Two mountaineering rangers in the area spotted the splitboarder on the surface of the debris and responded in minutes. After quickly assessing the splitboarder, the rangers initiated a beacon search. They found and exposed the skier within 9 minutes. ""CPR was initiated but discontinued after forty minutes due to traumatic injuries and no pulse.""

 I felt the piece catch, and then I started to fall again. My only thoughts were, “Okay, the piece came out, maybe the next one will hold. Nope. Maybe the third.” And then I was on the ground, lying on my back. I looked up and said, “I’m okay!
